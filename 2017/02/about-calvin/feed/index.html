					<description><![CDATA[Hi Everyone!
My name is Aditi Jhaveri and I&#039;m an Junior at Wellesley College. I&#039;m an international student from Mumbai, India and am majoring in Women&#039;s and Gender Studies and Economics. I am a really talkative and fun person; I love eating and discovering new restaurants and baking. I am incredibly interested in print and graphic design, but would love to learn more about the process of &quot;design&quot; and creation. I come to this class as a student and an activist –– incredibly eager to learn and tap into the power of media and aware of the power of youth in social movements.

One groups that I most recently learned about was BAGLY - Boston Alliance of Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual and Transgender Youth. This group is a Massachusetts wide group that works towards social justice for LGBTQ youth. The organization focuses on providing &quot;safe spaces&quot; for LGBTQ youth to promote discussion and open communication with one another. Through leadership programs, the organization enables youth to understand the power dynamics and systems of oppression that exist both within and outside the LGBTQ &quot;community&quot;. The organization also advocates for social acceptance of diversity, and challenges institutional discrimination against LGBTQ youth.  

I find their work inspiriting because it is amazing to watch youth come together, for over thirty years, to fight systematic and social oppression. I also think it is incredible that this organization focuses on education and social awareness, not just legal reform.
