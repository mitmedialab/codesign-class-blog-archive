					<description><![CDATA[Sounds like a great first meeting! I think for your 3rd possible idea, it will be really crucial to get in touch with groups that are working on something similar (coordination app for home cleaning coops). Specifically, it&#039;s worth writing and calling the folks from Si Se Puede, the Center for Family Life, and Coopify. Try to track down Emma Yorra (http://east.usworker.coop/users/emma-yorra), Si Se Puede Coop (http://www.wecandoit.coop), the team from Cornell Tech, and others who say they are in the testing stages of their app (http://community-wealth.org/content/coopify-new-platform-bringing-broad-based-ownership-your-smartphone). Ideally, they will either be open to Vida Verde beta testing, or will share their code!]]></description>
