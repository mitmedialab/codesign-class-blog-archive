					<description><![CDATA[WordPress doesn&#039;t have collective post authorship and Jason doesn&#039;t seem to be available to update the post, so here&#039;s my update in a comment for now:

Ben&#039;s goal for this week was to follow up with some of the restaurants, grocery stores, and (via restaurants) building managers we visited and interviewed last week in order to reach the decision makers.  We have also entered our leads into CERO&#039;s lead, contact, and deal tracker, Base.  This, as has been CERO&#039;s experience, has proven much more difficult than talking with front-line staff and even managers, who, as we learned last week, don&#039;t know where the waste goes after they put it in bins.  Waiting on calls or e-mails back (or sufficient time to pass to follow up again) from Thomas at Morton&#039;s The Steakhouse, the head of procurement at Legal Seafoods corporate (locations will not divulge any information), Miguel at Harvest Coop, and most interestingly, the real estate and building management services behemoth JLL, which we know to compost at some locations at least and to talk up a good environmental sustainability game, http://www.us.jll.com/united-states/en-us/services/corporates]]></description>
