<p>Abstract:Â Displacement of residents is a growing problem in many communities in the Boston area. However, this crisis in the making remains mostly unknown, partially owing to the fact that those impacted are often low-income immigrants whose primary language is one other than English. To counter both the lack of attention as well as the anti-immigrant sentiment that buoys displacement, we propose an interactive mobile installation that allows residents of neighborhoods to label locations that they consider to be their homes, giving a face to the victims of displacement and also demonstrating the problem&#8217;s magnitude.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract</strong><strong>:</strong></p>
<p>Open Book/Libro Abierto is designed to be a versatile platform for community members to share their stories. The print medium allows users to interact with the book in a tactile way, physically making their mark on the story of their community. The book presents handwritten and printed words along with photos of community members, and offers viewers access to audio interviews via QR links. Our goal is to create a hackable book that invites viewers to share their stories and start conversations, responding in whatever medium they choose. The book will be exhibited in Urbanoâs Nomadic Sculpture, where visitors will be able to read the stories and respond by writing directly in the book. We hope to foster productive and honest conversations about what displacement andÂ <span style="font-weight: 300;">community mean to the people of Egleston Square, both physically written in the book as well as verbally during and after the exhibition.</span></p>

<p><strong>Abstract</strong><strong>:</strong>Â &#8220;East Boston Voices&#8221; is a podcast special centered around events of gentrification and displacement in East Boston. The mission of Peas in a Podcast is to unveil the hidden stories of the neighborhood to the greater Boston community, hopefully instigating change among East Bostonâs residents. Each member of our group interviewed someone in the community whoâs dealing with the effects of gentrification and displacement directly, compiling their stories and presenting their contents to our audience with added data and thought-provoking questions.</p>

			<p>Kathy, Nina, Max and I finished and installed the project last night! I have lots of photos and video to share at class tonight. Within the night and morning, people walking past shared dozens of thoughts about Central and the photos we took. At some point today, someone stole the sharpies, which we expected to happen. I&#8217;m satisfied with the ephemeral nature of the project (and I&#8217;ve already noticed people bringing their own pens).</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p dir="ltr">I found the course readings on discotechs, design jams, and hackathons to be very interesting and relatable, despite not being a computer science/design person myself. Much of what I learned from the readings was new information to me although I did have some inkling as to the various perks and problems of hackathons thanks to hearing about many of my friendsâ various experiences.</p>
<p dir="ltr">I agree with <a href="https://civic.mit.edu/blog/cfd/hackathons-dont-solve-problems">Charlie Detar</a> that hackathons donât, or canât, solve big problems. It is unreasonable to believe that solutions to large scale issues can be created in the span of a couple days. However, because I have such limited knowledge of and experience with hackathons (and discotechs, and design jams) I was under the impression that most hackathons were meant to be a space where one can meet other people interested in tech and collaborate on fun projects. Perhaps this is because the only hackathon I have ever been to is WHACK, Wellesleyâs hackathon, which I have heard offers a more inclusive and relaxed environment than other hackathons. WHACK is also great because it caters to women in tech, who are often marginalized, and offers them a safe space to hack. I believe that this specific hackathon serves a good purpose because it allows women to be comfortable doing design with others and invites people who may not have a tech background explore in a welcoming environment. I understand that this is not the norm, though, and that they can sometimes foster more toxic environments.</p>
<p dir="ltr">From the many friends I have in CS and tech I know that there is an unhealthy lifestyle associated with hacking that is almost glorified within these departments and at hackathons. People often stay up late and get very little, if any, hours of sleep and really on heavily caffeinated beverages to stay awake. While I knew there was pressure for participants to sleep as little as possible in order to âmaximizeâ productivity at hackathons, I was shocked to learn that there were sometimes no sleeping areas available or that hackers were â<a href="https://modelviewculture.com/pieces/masculinity-and-machinery-analysis-of-care-practices-social-climate-and-marginalization-at-hackathons">restricted to sleeping on concrete slabs</a>.â Itâs upsetting that the people organizing the hackathons arenât prioritizing participantsâ health which can then lead to participants picking up habits they start at hacks and carrying them into their own life. Going without sleep or proper food and hygiene is not a sustainable way to live nor does it contribute to being productive when the point of these hackathons is to find solutions to problems, not create more.</p>
<p>From what I have seen personally, though that experience was limited, and what I learned through the readings I believe that hackathons are worthwhile and important so long as they are organized with reasonable goals in mind and with programming that helps to foster a more healthy hacking environment. Hackathons should help promote interest in tech and hacking instead of trying to tackle on impossible issues. This way we can grow a network of people who can later work on these issues with the amount of care and time they deserve and need.</p>

<p dir="ltr">I interviewed Jorge Caraballo Cordovez and his partner, Felisa, as part of the East Boston group.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Jorge came to speak to our class about his work with <a href="https://camd.northeastern.edu/journalism/2017/03/13/student-addresses-displaced-communities-east-boston/">East Boston, Nuestra Casa</a>. He explained that when he first moved to Boston as an international student from Colombia studying journalism at Northeastern, he became especially interested in learning more about East Boston. He heard from many people that the area was populated by many Latinx people and would remind him of home, which it did. After doing journalism work in the community, he began to hear about issues of gentrification and displacement from the people who lived in the area. Many of the people affected, some of whom only spoke Spanish, were unaware of their rights as tenants. This led to the creation of his postcard project, which we in the Co-Design Studio were fortunate enough to hear about and see the postcards firsthand.</p>
<p>Since we had already heard about East Boston, Nuestra Casa I decided to focus on Jorge and Felisaâs personal experiences and observations regarding gentrification and displacement in East Boston. It was interesting for me to hear from them as they are both immigrants and students living in East Boston; the two are often shown at odds with each other when it comes to displacement. Perhaps the most important thing I heard from them was that while displacement and gentrification is a serious issue that disproportionately hurts Latinx people and immigrants, it is not the fault of the people who then move in and take their place as tenants. We all need a place to live and it is the responsibility of the government to ensure that there is enough affordable housing for all.</p>

<p>T<span style="font-weight: 300">oday I marched with City Life/Vida Urbana in the Wake Up the Earth Parade from Egleston Square to Stony Brook.Â  We chanted a broader message to âStand Up, Fight Back!â while at the same time marching as allies to specific tenants facing eviction near Washington Street. The energy the tenants, activists, and allies </span>was<span style="font-weight: 300"> powerful, and as we marched, residents and festival-goers joined the chanting, took pictures, and waved in solidarity. Our part of the march was just a tiny part of the Wake Up the Earth Festival, a vibrant display of the culture of JP and Roxbury, but it seemed to resonate with the entire co</span><span style="font-weight: 300">mmunity. Every chant of âWhose home? OUR HOME!â got louder as the spectators and other marchers joined in.</span></p>
<p><a href="../../wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_4299.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2614" alt="IMG_4299" src="../../wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_4299-1024x682.jpg" width="584" height="388" srcset="../../wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_4299-1024x682.jpg 1024w, ../../wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_4299-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 584px) 100vw, 584px" /></a></p>
<p>As we prepared for the parade, I had the fortune of being able to interview three people. I joined Sam and her Nuvu classmate to talk with City Life/Vida Urbana Community Organizer Alex Ponte-Capellan. Though Alex had already completed a much more detailed interview with Kobbie, he was able to provide a passionate introduction to why we were marching and prepare us to talk to other marchers. Alex broke down the word âgentrificationâ, talking about how that and other words like âmore affluentâ were coded language trying to hide the fact that white people are coming into neighborhoods and pus<span style="font-weight: 300">hing people of color out.</span></p>
<p><a href="../../wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_4303.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2616" alt="IMG_4303" src="../../wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_4303-1024x682.jpg" width="584" height="388" srcset="../../wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_4303-1024x682.jpg 1024w, ../../wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_4303-300x199.jpg 300w, ../../wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_4303-450x300.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 584px) 100vw, 584px" /></a></p>
<p>The second person<span style="font-weight: 300">I interviewed was Luis Cotto, Executive Director of Egleston Square Main Street, an organization that helps keep Egleston Square safe and beautiful for its residents and </span>strengthen<span style="font-weight: 300"> the businesses and public spaces. He is careful to help the local economy thrive while also trying </span>to<span style="font-weight: 300">keep rents affordable for community members, but sometimes improving local businesses can mean that landlords think they can charge more, both for </span>commercial<span style="font-weight: 300"> and residential property. As Cotto said, âcapitalism is funky that wayâ. Howe</span><span style="font-weight: 300">ver, h</span><span style="font-weight: 300">e tries to start amicable conversations with develops and policy makers to convince them to keep the communityâs best interests at heart. âCommunity gets defined in so many different waysâ, he says, and he wants to make sure local business owners who have been at the heart of that community for many years do not get priced out of the ne</span><span style="font-weight: 300">ighborhood.</span></p>
<p><a href="../../wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_4300.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2615" alt="IMG_4300" src="../../wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_4300-1024x682.jpg" width="584" height="388" srcset="../../wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_4300-1024x682.jpg 1024w, ../../wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_4300-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 584px) 100vw, 584px" /></a></p>
<p>My third interviewee was Rene Bernal, a tenant facing displacement head on. Despite living in his apa<span style="font-weight: 300">rtment for a decade, he was asked to leave so that developer City Realty could take over the building. He knew that trying to find a home somewhere else would mean being forced to take his children out of their current schools and hurt their chances at a good future. Rather than giving in to their landlord trying to force them to leave, he and the other tenants formed an association and decided to fight back. With the help of City Life/Vida Urbana, they managed to secure a much smaller rent increase, but the real i</span>ssue, the length of the contract, remained unsolved. But he made sure to emphasize to me that<span style="font-weight: 300"> he and his fellow tenants were by no</span><span style="font-weight: 300">means alone in this struggle. He cited the large number of people at City Life meetings, all facing similar issues. And yet, the city government seemed blind to their needs. He said they were spending more and more on police in the neighborhood while neglecting housing and schools. Rather than accepting this fate, he</span><span style="font-weight: 300">boldly fights back and calls upon the government to change things. He wants the government to stop talking about fixing the city by some abstract date in the future and instead âfix it </span>nowâ,<span style="font-weight: 300"> because there are people from Roxbury to Chinatown who love their city and want to and deserve to stay.</span></p>

<p>On Tuesday, I met with <strong>Chad Shabazz</strong> in the cafe of the HMart on Central Square. I know Chad through a friend, though this was our first time meeting.</p>
<p>He had just finished a training session at his job as a youth advisor at the YCMA. He was wearing a black motorcycle jacket completely covered in patches; &#8220;People look at me and they&#8217;re surprised that I work with children. And the parents are surprised. And I take pride in that,&#8221; he told me.</p>
<p>Chadâs 33 years old. He&#8217;s from the Cambridge Coast, and grew up in Cambridge around Central. He&#8217;s <a href="https://soundcloud.com/chad-shabazz/the-city">written a song</a> about his experience growing up between MIT and Harvard.</p>
<p>His mom grew up in Boston, he tells me, around the Blue Hills area. Right now, he and his family live in in <strong>Cambridge Port.</strong> He spoke immediately and passionately about his experience, and struck me as someone with a sense of urgencyâand at the same time, optimism.</p>
<p>He shared his observations, and also his experience being evicted by Wynn Management as a young adult. I&#8217;ve clipped and transcribed parts of our conversation that moved, frustrated, or interested me. <strong>(Read more&#8230;)</strong></p>

			<p>I&#8217;ve been very overloaded between work, NuVu, several migraines and two allergic reactions so I designated time today to get this post from last week done.</p>
<p>I interviewedÂ Carlos Espinoza-Toro from the Jamaica Plain Neighborhood Development Corporation (JPNDC). <a title="Google Drive Folder with audio files" href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B-Mbw1qxCDOGX0ZBa1U1N0NyTDA" target="_blank">This is a link to my interview</a>.</p>
<p>Carlos and I talked about the JPNDC&#8217;s work with small business-owners and their families.The JPNDC does a lot of work with businesses facing eviction. Many businesses facing eviction/displacement don&#8217;t have the information they need to fight back against exploitative landlords. The JPNDC is able to support local families&#8217; businesses, which protects them and their community against interests that are trying to extract value from their land by kicking them out.</p>
<p>The JPNDC often acts as a connector, linking lawyers and community advocates (especially from groups like Harvard Legal Aid Bureau and City Life / Vida Urbana) with tenants or small family business-owners. This can level balance of power between landlords and residents, since landlords often begin with a greater understanding of the law. Even knowing that they are allowed to fight a displacement can be a significant improvement for residents or business-owners.</p>
<p>Carlos and I discussed the difference between the words gentrification and displacement as they relate to the people he works with. When people talk about gentrification, he said that they often focus on the new residents entering an area. He believes that it is important to consider the people that are pressured to leave an area as a result of economic, cultural and other changes that occur in tandem with new residents moving in. This concept, displacement, more directly refers to the people who have to leave.</p>
<p>Carlos talked about specific cases like a group of tenants whose landowner sent them a notice that their building had changed ownership and they were not sure of the significance of the document they were being asked to sign. This uncertainty was aggravated by the fact that the residents &#8220;didn&#8217;t speak English very well&#8230;they were afraid to sign it.&#8221; When they reached out to the JPNDC, they partnered with several other local organizations (like Egleston Square Main Streets, and City Life / Vida Urbana). The tenants didn&#8217;t have enough money (&gt;$5,000) so Carlos applied for a mini-grant from the Massachusetts Growth Capital Corporation so that the tenants would be able to pay for legal representation from Gabriel Mendoza. This let them negotiate with the new landlords for support towards their relocation. Carlos considered this a &#8220;great model for helping tenants going through the exact same situation.&#8221;</p>
<p>I interviewed Carlos a second time on video, at the JPNDC. This interview will be included in a film that I&#8217;m making, along with interviews with a number of other activists, professors and people fighting displacement.</p>
