			<p>(Update from Apr 19)</p>
<p>Comments of the <a href="https://surveillance.hackpad.com/CODESIGN-STUDIO-2014-Week-8-w7s29CyP3RN">Class Review</a> of our <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/14UwwuQa3fTEtYkaa-2NDNg5ISUEgaB-LbADuifokerI/edit#slide=id.p">Project Update</a>:</p>
<p>The class brought up many important points during our discussion after our presentation.  Our designs are still at an early stage, as we are still working through the main goal of our project and figuring out what the final product will be &#8211; whether it is a place for the community to share their infiltration stories or is it a place for SoMove to control and post stories they feel should be broadcast?  (We are hoping to end with a good combination of both.)</p>
<p>Here are some main points that were brought up during class, as well as our take on them and how we will think about these points in the future:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>What is infiltration?  </strong>This is important to define on the website &#8211; if people new to this topic visit our site, we want to make sure that when they leave, they&#8217;ll know exactly what it is and how it is defined, and hopefully even be able to cite a few of the stories we share.</li>
<li><strong>Concerns about crowd-sourcing the stories:  </strong>We are heavily considering a section of the website for people to submit their own stories of infiltration.  The current plan is to allow people to submit stories, and then have a moderator sift through these stories to see if there are any in particular that we want to delve into more.  If there is a particular story we want more information on, SoMove might even fly the submitter in and create a sort of mini-documentary or audio file interview or something that will VISUALLY be put on the website in liu of that story that was submitted.</li>
<li><strong>SoMove has a strength, which is recording and producing oral histories (audio &amp; video). There is concern that focusing on crowd sourced content won&#8217;t play to this strength enough:</strong>  We do not want all the stories on the site to be text based, because SoMove is an ORAL HISTORY focused organization &#8211; they thrive off of audio and visual formats, not text!  We want to adhere to that philosophy and provide them a platform where they can add their video or audio files, as well as attach relevant text files or pdfs for viewers to access.</li>
</ul>

			<p>During this week, we scraped the data from Cambridge police logs. We&#8217;ve got roughly 3600 lines of data of police reports. We&#8217;ve found that some of them are relevant to our research. (e.g. search with keywords like &#8220;computer&#8221; or &#8220;hacking&#8221;) There are also other interesting findings, such as police refer &#8220;domestic violence (DV)&#8221; to &#8220;domestic dispute&#8221;, which may provide some insight to workers in DV field.</p>
<p>We started to design the user interface for a database. Advocates can use this database to explore the uncharted sea of domestic surveillance. The database allow advocates and general public search among vast of police logs, which was unfriendly to researchers in the past. The database will also allow advocates and domestic violence shelter staff comment on logged cases, tag on cases to summarize device and technology uses, and submit new cases. This tool will be included in IPVTech, a resource center for people who want to eliminate intimate partner violence or abuse through technology.</p>
<p>The next step is to choose the proper web technology and build the interface out. We also contacted some interviewees and tried to reach out Cambridge Police. So interviews are also included in our schedule.</p>

			<div id="magicdomid83">This week&#8217;s &#8220;Fail Hard&#8221; workshop in class addressed many of our concerns and questions regarding our collaborative project with UYC. As  none of the members of our group can code, building an app for UYC would have required extensive help from Neo or other programmers. Additionally, there are several platforms, including <a title="http://vojo.co/" href="http://vojo.co/">Vojo</a>, that already perform many of the functions that UYC requires (sharing stories, text and video, as well as geo-mapping).</div>
<div></div>
<div id="magicdomid85">Our updated project is then to work on the front end for the Vojo page, and we will be meeting with Maria and Yorman to discuss how they would like to have that designed (e.g. an independent website/blog or as an additional page on the UYC website). We would like to test the efficacy of this platform with student users as soon as possible, so that we can get any issues with contributing to/using the site sorted out before the end of the semester.</div>
<div></div>
<div id="magicdomid87">This weekend we looked over Vojo and familiarized ourselves with the tools on the website. For our second iteration we have created a <a title="http://vojo.co/en/groups/uyc-test" href="http://vojo.co/en/groups/uyc-test">sample website</a> that features the functions of the app we initially planned, most importantly the story uploading, pictures, text and heat-mapping. We have added several stories via email, text, and the blog function on Vojo, taking examples from UYC&#8217;s website and creating example &#8220;profiles&#8221; to show how telling stories will look like on this platform.</div>
<div></div>
<div id="magicdomid89">During this week&#8217;s meeting with UYC, we will take them through this alternative, and answer their questions about Vojo&#8217;s functionality, as well as get their feedback on refining the page further.</div>
<div></div>
<div>This week was incredibly helpful, since we will be able to use Vojo to achieve most of our initial goals with the app. We will be speaking with NEO this evening, and get their feedback on some of our questions on developing the website, including the possibility of a &#8216;skin&#8217; for mobile that allows users easy access to the site, and/or suggestions for optimizing the web page/site.</div>

			<p>During the class review of our project we got a lot of useful feedback. The presentation outlined my project partners, the ACLU and the Guardian Project, and their missions &#8212; leaving some of the detailed information to Kade and Nathan who were in class to talk after presentations. I then gave a quick overview of the cellular topology and how cell phones connect to the network and trasnmit data back and forth &#8212; again leaving out specifics as Nathan was giving a talk specifically on this. I then talked about IMSI-catchers or Stingray devices, and how they can be used to intercept data. To put our project into context, I went over our team values and project goals and talked about the various user personae. Finally, I went over a few of the design candidates that we&#8217;re considering and talked about the one that we have started to implement.</p>
<p>The feedback from the class was really helpful. After the presentation a few questions led to the discussion of what would happen post-discovery of an IMSI-catcher or Stingray device. This is something that I hadn&#8217;t really thought of as an important aspect of the project/application. Initially I saw the main value of the application to be the alerting feature &#8212; purely a technological/engineering approach. It turned out that the audience didn&#8217;t know what they should do given the information that their signal is possibly intercepted. One member told us to consider suggesting to users where safe places are. Another asked specifically in what ways they should they react to finding out that they are being spied on. This is something to really think about and sort out going forward. A naive solution would be to present a set of steps that informs the user of things to do &#8212; such as turn off the phone, move to a safe location, and report the behavior.</p>
<p>Some of the feedback around sharing the information recorded was a little unexpected. We initially hypothesized that people would not want to necessarily share their data &#8212; the data pertaining to the possibility of an IMSI-catcher detection. It turns out that this seems to be an incredibly useful feature &#8212; and one that people would want. Specifically one member of the audience suggested, &#8220;Consider sharing publicly when an IMSI catcher is found via FB, twitter, with a hashtag&#8221;. This brings additional benefits such as alerting as many people about the issue as possible and increasing awareness of the subject, and letting law enforcement know that we know what they&#8217;re up to.</p>
<p>Finally, the biggest thing we learned is that there are a lot of people who don&#8217;t really know what the issue it or why it should matter to them. A suggestion was made to make it more friendly to people who aren&#8217;t aware or who don&#8217;t care about being under surveillance. A member of the audience suggested that we &#8220;make them somehow more aware of why it&#8217;s important&#8221;, and someone else agreed with this. This is something that we are addressing and will test in the next phase of our design process. It&#8217;s also something that we hope to address before people get their hands on our application. Hopefully we have a website or description of the app available and why people should care.</p>

			<p>(April 13th Update)</p>
<p>Around spring break, we came up with some ideas on how to format information on a website.  We decided to focus on gathering stories from people and organizations that have been infiltrated, and the decision now had to be made on how to best visualize all these stories.  Here is a <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/14UwwuQa3fTEtYkaa-2NDNg5ISUEgaB-LbADuifokerI/edit#slide=id.p">presentation </a>with updates on our project&#8217;s current standing, and towards the end are some sketches of design ideas we had.  One is text based and another is video/media based &#8211; but the one that our collaborator, SoMove, liked the best is the map visualization.</p>
<p>Sort of thinking along the lines of GoogleMaps, Richard and I thought we could have a map background and pinpoints on the map of where sources of infiltration happened &#8211; and when the user clicked on one of these points, a story or new web page would pop up, describing the occurrence.  (We don&#8217;t want to focus on a &#8220;GoogleMap&#8221; format though &#8211; we want a map visualization, but do not necessarily want to be tied to Google &#8211; we want our own identity.)</p>
<p>The benefits of having a map visualization:  1) It would allow us to organize stories by location, and maybe even extent of infiltration. 2) We can easily see that many occurrences are happening within a certain area. 3) It&#8217;s more visual and interactive for the user &#8211; always a plus!</p>
<p>Next on the agenda is coming up with different designs for a map-visualization, and figuring out the structure of the website.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><em>This is the &#8220;director&#8217;s cut&#8221; of a shorter article about the Cambridge DiscoTech published in <a href="http://digboston.com/boston-news-opinions/2014/03/tech-hacking-back-at-surveillance/">The Dig</a>. Reposted with permission.<br />
</em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">You enter the Center for Civic Media through MIT’s fabled Media Lab, its lobby full of prototype future vehicles and artificial limbs. The elevator takes you up through the atrium, surrounded by glass walled labs with names like “Laboratory for the Connected World” and “Viral Spaces”. As you walk back to “Civic”, as it’s called, you encounter a different vibe, a hodgepodge of chairs and couches, and random artifacts like an outsized cowboy hat and a cutout Dr. Who Dalek. Civic’s vibe is not the only difference. While the Media Lab is in many ways an advanced research and development lab for capitalism, the scholars and students of Civic study things like how the Trayvon Martin story moved from social to mainstream media or how Anonymous’s denial-of-service cyber attacks fit into a history of physical denials of service such as boycotts and sit-ins.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Codesign Studio, a class taught for the last few years by Assistant Professor Sasha Costanza–Chock functions as a critique of the expertise culture of MIT. The Studio’s core premise is collaborative design, that those creating for a community should design in a partnership with that community and should recognize the expertise and knowledge of community members. Collaborative design arose in the United States during 1990s, a response to the time when computers were still relatively rare, but were beginning to be used to define solutions and impose processes for large groups. Viewing these as a technologies of control, the “participatory design movement” strove to democratize these systems, starting with their design.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Chock, along with his teaching team, chose to focus this semester’s Studio on surveillance. While the Media Lab partners with corporations like Panasonic, Samsung, Google and Microsoft, the Studio’s partners represent a very different stratum of society. &#8220;Traditional&#8221; civil rights groups are present via the Electronic Freedom Foundation and the ACLU, but so are groups representing immigrants, public school students, victims of domestic violence and sex offenders. Each organization’s constituency has, in its own way, become a focus of surveillance. In New York schools, school security is handled by the NYPD, criminalizing misbehavior and creating what the Urban Youth Collaborative calls the school to prison pipeline. The Detention Watch Network focuses on ending mandatory detention of undocumented immigrants, for-profit prisons, and the detention bed quota, the mandate to fill 34,000 beds each night with the undocumented. Citizens United for Rehabilitation of believes that sex offender registries, by combining offenses as divergent as public urination and serial rape, create a class of people who are under life-long surveillance despite a low statistical probability of recidivism. TOR, the software project intended to provide enhanced privacy and security on the Internet, has joined with Transition House, the Cambridge-based domestic violence shelter, to increase awareness of how often victims of domestic violence are targeted for electronic stalking by their abusers. Entire networks of shelters and support groups have had their computers and phones compromised, and the police response is often unhelpful.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">If hackathons are old enough to be said to have traditions, Saturday’s event at the Media Lab was non-traditional. In a more usual hackathon, there are introductions, perhaps some brief talks framing the purpose of the hackathon, then people with projects make pitches seeking to recruit other attendees to work on their projects. Then, it’s head-down hacking, sometimes overnight, until time runs out. <span> </span>A critique of hackathons is that they rarely meet their overt goals and that their true value is in the connections and community they create. This event was structured with that critique in mind, using a DiscoTech (“Discover Technology”) format and being more a community organized workshop/fair than a software-oriented hackathon. After introductions, participants break up into small groups and share stories about how surveillance has affected their lives. This serves as both an ice breaker and brief education. After hearing stories involving racial profiling and surveillance of dissidents, one participant asked to revise his answer that he’d not been affected by surveillance. His job, managing spam for a large email provider, his work was surveillance.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Short talks follow and then lunch. The measure of the approximately forty people who attended is that, in one lunch conversation, two people who had never previously met, compared notes on their last few weeks in Iraq where they had set up hacker and maker spaces, community networks and anti-car bomb community surveillance systems.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Meanwhile, similar events were taking place across the globe. In San Francisco, there was a hackathon focused on making the user interfaces of privacy and security tools more accessible. People in Bangalor, India worked on repurposing old closed circuit surveillance cameras. In Mexico City, participants given color coded ribbons to wear, indicating whether or not they wished to be photographed and were urged not to live tweet or live blog the sessions as some individuals might have specific security concerns. The San Francisco event was part of RightsCon, an annual meeting whose is goal protecting the open internet and the digital rights of its users.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">After lunch, Cambridge attendees joined small workshops. One group experimented with facial recognition software and face painting, seeing what sorts of colors and designs worked to fool this increasingly prevalent surveillance tool. Another group held a threat model workshop, allowing people to map their assets, what threats may target those and the risk associated with those threats. This will allow the EFF to make their Surveillance Self Defense web site more approachable.<span>  </span>A third group worked on “IMSEI catchers”, counterfeit cell phone infrastructure that allows governments and cyber-criminals to identify all cell phones in a specific area. The goal for this ACLU project is to find some way to, at least, notify a cell phone user that an IMSEI catcher probed their phone. Another group walked through the Kendall Square area, mapping public surveillance cameras.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">As people moved from workshop to workshop, the day wound down slowly. Video hangouts were held with some of the other events, and as the sun set, a day of countersurveillance work came to a close.</p>

			<p>We want to make something that really helps people in the field. We want to make something that will be not only opened or installed once. After further identifying the needs of our partners, we shifted the scope of our final product to a website that helps advocates to better carry out their job in helping domestic surveillance survivors.</p>
<p>The website will include statistics (data visualization) and qualitative descriptions of cases on stalking/harassment by digital devices. It will include information on digital forensic techniques that helps advocates know what we can do to this issue. A typical scenario of this website is when a survivor comes into a shelter and reports a case of digital-related stalking and harassment, the advocate can understand the issue by reading information provided by our mini website.</p>
<p>The most important task of this project is mapping the field. Knowing the enemies is the first step to drive off fear and defeat them. For this, Getting data is more important than talking about technology. In the past weeks, we are planning to interview several forensic experts. We&#8217;ve designed and revised the interview questions. We also collected resources (documents and papers) to understand this issue. We will finish scraping police logs from Cambridge police by this Friday, and build a database for further research.</p>

			<div id="magicdomid63">This past Wednesday we presented our three design candidates in class &#8211; a texting service, an app, and a &#8220;selfie&#8221; photo project. We received a lot of feedback on our project designs that we discussed during a Thursday meeting with Maria.</div>
<div id="magicdomid64"></div>
<div id="magicdomid65">Our selfie photo project received great feedback during the class presentation and seems like a popular idea among students as well. However, after talking to Maria, we discussed the concerns regarding privacy and retribution. The concern was that students who show their face on these campaigns may be targeted by school officials or security officers for their participation. She noted that while there is still a possibility that students will be singled out by officers  when using an app recording events in real time, student and teacher witnesses to the action mitigate the risk to a degree. Mainly, there was also a concern about not being able to monitor an Instagram account for inappropriate material.</div>
<div id="magicdomid66"></div>
<div id="magicdomid67">So in this case, we decided that an app would probably be best for the purposes of this project. However, instead of just an input/output app that tells stories, the app should have fun and appealing aspects like social networking integration. Students should be able to communicate within the app, send texts, upload videos, chat, and tell stories as well. Based off of this platform, social media campaigns can possibly branch out. UYC can utilize their main instagram/twitter/facebook account and mobilize students to use hashtags for certain surveys, go out and explore surveillance, photo-document police presence, etc. Therefore, the app platform would be a good networking platform for students to communicate with each other and also tell their stories to the outside world.</div>
<div id="magicdomid68"></div>
<div id="magicdomid69">The design of the app will include several functions. There will definitely be pages regarding UYC information, contact and community events. Also, the app will have information telling students what their rights are and how to counter police abuse.</div>
<div id="magicdomid70"></div>
<div id="magicdomid71">The core of the app will include photo sharing, story submissions, inter-member communication and various ways to view the submissions. Instead of all the submissions falling under individual student accounts, the students should rather submit their stories and picture to the app, and then UYC can comb through submissions and post them at a central location viewable to everyone in the app. Therefore, all the photo submissions and stories will fall under those &#8220;uploaded&#8221; by UYC and not individual students. Likewise, important media campaign photos will be gathered by UYC and can be uploaded through a centralized instagram/twitter account (perhaps this can eliminate some of the retribution). Whenever there are hashtag campaigns, students can use individual submissions and then tag them for UYC to post.</div>
<div id="magicdomid72"></div>
<div id="magicdomid73">Inside the app will also be a function where students can connect with other students from the same or different schools. Students can learn about what goes on in other school systems and even make friends. The app can also even have a chatroom function with a live feed. Another possibility is adding a function where students create their own discussion logs or advice panels to gather peer input (for example, asking for advice on something that happened in school and what to do). The social networking component would probably be an important aspect of the usability aspect of this app.</div>
<div id="magicdomid74"></div>
<div id="magicdomid75">Overall, instead of being just an app for information, this UYC app can possibly act as a platform for further social media campaigns. By drawing students in and connecting them with others, the app will allow UYC broader influence among students and mobilize them to participate in UYC activities and campaigns, rather than just 1 selfie campaign on instagram.</div>
<div id="magicdomid76"></div>
<div id="magicdomid77">UYC are having their monthly meeting today (07th April), and Maria will present the design candidates to UYC members for their feedback. We will be discussing this, as well as class feedback on our first iteration during our weekly meeting on Thursday, which will feed into our second iteration of the app next week. At present, our app draws inspiration from NYCLU&#8217;s Stop and Frisk Watch app, and a multimedia app called Com-Phone Story Maker that brings together photo/video/text elements to tell a story.</div>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>Last week Kade and Nathan, from the ACLU and The Guardian Project respectively, gave a great talk about the problem we&#8217;re tackling: IMSI-catcher detection. Before their presentations I gave a presentation on the status of our project and got some great feedback. Based on the feedback and questions it&#8217;s apparent that we really figure out how to make sure people realize the problem that exists and why it might be important to them &#8212; how to really capture attention and get people to use our application long term.</p>
<p>Nathan went over our project at a very technical level: how cell towers work, how cellphones work, and why the problem is very challenging. He talked about E911 and how stolen phones can be blocked or turned off so they no longer work. These technologies and features are useful but make cellular phones relatively insecure even though they&#8217;re being relied upon more and more everyday.</p>
<p>Kade gave a great presentation on the legality of the issues and why this is actually a problem. She really answered the question of, &#8220;why should I care if I&#8217;m tracked, I don&#8217;t have anything to hide&#8221;. Kade went through several case studies such as the Ukrainian Government and NAACP v Patterson. She talked about the companies making Stringray devices (IMSI-catcher related products for law-enforcement use) and how law-enforcement agencies use this technology.</p>
<p>Our project is really starting to take shape and we&#8217;re working in parallel on the design and the technology for an Android application. While we&#8217;ve discussed many possible design candidates, we&#8217;ve really set down with one and are beginning to implement it. We are planning a work-party which will basically be a hackathon in which we can all get together and combine our knowledge to be more efficient. This will leverage the group knowledge on the problem at hand and allow everyone to work at full speed.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I presented several versions and mockups of the application during last week&#8217;s project update presentations.  The above mockup shows the direction we&#8217;re heading and what we&#8217;ve currently been user testing with paper prototypes.  User testing has allowed us to gauge the level of knowledge of people in our various user groups and figure out how people might interact with the application.</p>
