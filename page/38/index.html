<p>I&#8217;m excited to announce that the Civic Media: Codesign Studio course will be held again during the Fall Semester in 2013. We&#8217;ve received support from the MIT Teaching and Learning Fund to increase the number of students who can join and the number of community partners we can work with. Please spread the word, and look for announcements soon about who the partners will be. You can also check out the drafting space for the new version of the course syllabus, here: <a href="http://bit.ly/fallcodesignstudio2013">http://bit.ly/fallcodesignstudio2013</a>. Hope to see you in September!</p>

			<p>The <a href="../../index.html">Codesign Studio</a> concluded on Tues May 14. This year we had 8 enrolled students, a mix of graduate and undergraduate students from around the institute, from Computer Science, Department of Urban Studies and Planning, Mechanical Engineering and from other universities &#8212; Boston University, Harvard’s Kennedy School, and Wellesley. Our partners were <strong><a href="../../2013/02/cctv-introduction/index.html">Cambridge Community Television (CCTV)</a></strong> and <strong><a href="../../2013/02/ds4si-introduction/index.html">Design Studio for Social Intervention (DS4SI)</a>.</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.beckyhurwitzthemusical.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/MPPP_poster-flyer_web-231x300.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2169" alt="MPPP_poster-flyer_web-231x300" src="http://www.beckyhurwitzthemusical.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/MPPP_poster-flyer_web-231x300.jpg" width="231" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>This is the second time I&#8217;ve TA&#8217;d this class. The following are some observations from the courses in 2012 and 2013 and how these are helping us to reflect and iterate on the structure of the course and how these iterations played out in the most recent term. In Spring 2012, <a href="http://schock.cc">Sasha Costanza Chock</a> was instructor. You can see the 2012 syllabus here: <a href="http://brownbag.me:9001/p/codesignstudio">http://brownbag.me:9001/p/codesignstudio</a>. In that class, students worked individually and in small groups with community partners to collaboratively design media and communication projects and the syllabus was a mix of theoretical grounding at the intersection of collaborative design and social justice and hands-on codesign: <a href="../../index.html%3Fp=466.html">http://codesign.mit.edu/projects/</a>. Most class meetings were split between discussion of readings to provide theoretical and historical context and hands-on activities facilitated by project groups. In Spring 2013, with <a href="http://mobile.mit.edu/people/federico/">Federico Casalegno</a> as the lead instructor and <a href="http://hellodenise.com/">Denise Cheng</a> and myself as TAs, the class worked in 2 groups. In early classes, the class developed an understanding of codesign through investigating existing work and becoming familiar with their partners’ work. This semester, our partners joined us during class meetings and for most of the semester, class meetings began with group updates and were followed by separate group work. You can see the syllabus here: <a href="http://bit.ly/codesignstudio2013">http://bit.ly/codesignstudio2013</a>.</p>
<p>Some of the changes to the structure of the course were made in response to observations about the 2012 course. The goal in making these changes was to create container in which students and partners were able to practice design together and to focus on the projects more than the project development.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.beckyhurwitzthemusical.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/cambridge-responds.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2168" alt="cambridge-responds" src="http://www.beckyhurwitzthemusical.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/cambridge-responds.png" width="400" height="391" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Observation</strong>: Building partnerships and to specifying projects takes time<br />
<strong>Adjustment</strong>: Create project partnerships and identify problems in advance of the beginning of the term</p>
<p>In 2012 students were responsible for forming a partnership with a community partner and identifying a problem or project to work on together. These steps took more time for some groups which meant less time for experimenting and implementing. In order to remove these initial steps so that groups could begin the course instead with developing their working relationships and designing and iterating, we initiated the partnerships and identified problems together before the start of the class.</p>
<p>In December and January, I spoke with a number of potential partners for the course. At the start of the term, we had 3 partners prepared to join the class and I had spoken to an additional two. One of our partners, a student organizing group, was unable to join as we began the term because the people who would have joined our class had classes of their own at the same time.</p>
<p>Of the potential partners I spoke with with whom we did not partner for the class, joining the meeting time weekly was a limitation. Some of these groups are volunteer committees and both making the time to join the class and agreeing on a problem of high priority to address through the class were challenges.</p>
<p>Even with partnerships and problem definitions in place, groups evolve as the term continues developing intragroup working relationships and clarifying project aims as they iterate.</p>
<p><strong>Observation</strong>: Class time was separate from group working time, creating separation between conceptual learning and practice<br />
<strong>Adjustment</strong>: To create one shared space for the processes of learning and practicing codesign, we invited partners to join the class during class time</p>
<p>Feedback at the end of the term from partners was that this format allowed for weekly meeting times that were productive, but that the time commitment was challenging some weeks. It also meant that the groups had enough time to communicate and work together.</p>
<p>Each group included 2 individuals from the partner organizations and as the term continued, the individuals alternated attending class so there was one member present for each class meeting. This seemed to work fine and split the time between 2 people.</p>
<p>Holding the class meetings as a space for both enrolled students and partners did create <strong>formal space for inclusion of additional voices in decision making</strong>. After the midterm, both groups met with more members of their partner groups. From the midterm discussion, it was clear to the CCTV group that the journalists were a key part of increasing the visibility of the NeighborMedia program. The CCTV group met with NeighborMedia journalists continuously for the remainder of the course. The DS4SI group included the 2 directors of DS4SI in the class immediately following the midterm review and had a clarifying discussion, confirming some design choices and laying out open needs and questions.</p>
<p>One element lost from engaging during class meeting times with project teams was that teams were not explicitly required to meet together in one another’s spaces. In future courses, we should suggest or require that <strong>groups work early and throughout the course in the partners’ spaces some weeks and in the campus meeting space other weeks.</strong> This will help the group to ground their suggestions and plans in understanding of the partner’s operating environment.</p>
<p><strong>Observation</strong>: Concluding projects is difficult<br />
<strong>Adjustment</strong>: We identified problems and projects with a clear end date, designed for a specific event</p>
<p>In the 2012 class and in our work at the Center more broadly, defining an end-point for an engagement can be difficult. If the work we are doing requires maintenance over time or ongoing administration and management &#8212; who will do that work? If the work we are doing together is iterating on existing services and campaigns, how do you decide when the final iteration is? To help ease defining the how the engagements for the 2013 class would end, projects, we defined this with our partners before the class began.</p>
<p>Reflecting on the popularity of hackathons, day to weeklong design and development sessions, we thought about designing the course as a critique of hackathons with a focus on collaboratiavely creating an inclusive design event.  In the end, our projects were developed for a specific event, but were not framed as hackathons.</p>
<p>We addressed this when we developed problem statements with our partners. With CCTV, our problem was how to increase the visibility of the NeighborMedia program in time for the 5 year Anniversary event; with DS4SI, our problem was how to make planning processes public as a component of the Making Planning Processes Public event.</p>
<p><strong>New observations from this term<br />
</strong>Our midterm review period was a moment that catalyzed collaboration in new ways because it required the groups to share proposed designs and to reflect on how their designs and aligned with the needs and interests of the partners. As a result, both groups met the following week with additional people from their partner organizations to have conversations that generated ideas more consistent with their partners’ needs and vision. I think we can actively create this kind of catalytic moment earlier in the semester by doing early sketch reviews or perhaps just by making this review earlier in the term.</p>
<p>Both teams were very multidisciplinary and the resulting work was an expression of their myriad skills and talents. This class has drawn students from MIT and elsewhere who are developing skills in wide ranging fields. This has led to rich projects in both semesters and is something we should continue to welcome.</p>
<p><strong>Enroll in the Fall 2013 Codesign Course!</strong></p>
<p>We’ll hold this class again in the Fall 2013 semester listed as <a href="http://student.mit.edu/catalog/mCMSa.html#CMS.362">CMS.362/.862, Tues 7-10pm E15-363</a>. Sasha Costanza Chock will again be the Instructor for the course and I’ll TA. We’ll be working on the design of the course this summer. Please consider signing up or getting in touch if you’re interested!</p>

<p><strong>Process</strong></p>
<p>The codesign process was incredibly iterative, and went through five stages.</p>
<p>In the first stage, we explored examples of successful codesign – <a href="https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B0k1thccTm5fb0V5Vldydzh5RG8/edit?usp=sharing">on a</a> <a href="https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B0k1thccTm5fanJVN0Exc2FIMVk/edit?usp=sharing">broad</a> <a href="https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B0k1thccTm5fb0lCUXJrMlBaTXM/edit?usp=sharing">level</a>, and <a href="https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B0k1thccTm5fNVFlOTJ2VUJrNVU/edit?usp=sharing">specifically in relation</a> <a href="https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B0k1thccTm5fZXF5STAxdkNiU2c/edit?usp=sharing">to issues similar to</a> CCTV and Design Studio for Social Intervention (the other organization the codesign class worked with). We used these examples to define codesign and understand what makes a codesigned project succeed. We found that some of the best codesign projects not only included stakeholders throughout the whole process, but sparked discussions between stakeholders who may not otherwise meet. An element of playfulness and a clear path to involvement were other key characteristics. In this stage, we also engaged in citizen journalism by reporting our own stories using <a href="http://locast.mit.edu/">Locast</a> and a <a href="http://i.imgur.com/lstnxLW.png">participatory planning</a> <a href="https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B0k1thccTm5fTU5QU2tyOUlzcm8/edit?usp=sharing">exercise</a> to experience first-hand the process of CCTV&#8217;s NeighborMedia journalists and the Design Studio for Social Intervention.</p>
<p>In the second stage, we split up into two groups and started working with CCTV. We started by talking with Clodagh Drummey (Associate Director of Programs and Development at CCTV) and Susan Fleischman (Executive Director of CCTV) about the problems they wanted us to address. We came up with the rough problem statement that <a>CCTV&#8217;s NeighborMedia program</a> lacks visibility even though it is one of the few local news sources in Cambridge. We also met with one of the NeighborMedia reporters, Saul Tannenbaum, to better understand the program.</p>
<p>After establishing the problem, we started to brainstorm project ideas. While we had Susan and Clodagh in each of our classes, most of our brainstorming was done in separate meetings and calls where they were not present. This later lead to a huge disconnect between our group and CCTV. We were brainstorming <a href="http://etherpad.mit.edu/p/m0z8do1DjJ">mostly high-tech projects that involved things like guerrilla projection and drones/copters</a>. We did not discuss these ideas in detail with CCTV let alone work with them to come up with the ideas in the first place.</p>
<p>In the third stage, we settled on our initial idea of a mini news helicopter/citizen journalist team for <a href="https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B0k1thccTm5fMUZnSWZZSU5KNTA/edit?usp=sharing">the midterm</a> <a href="http://etherpad.mit.edu/p/codesign-midterm">presentation</a>. We hoped a citizen journalist could use a copter to record and project interviews with people on the street. We researched how to make this work technically, came up with a plan for building it, and made <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=bA3gOZsu-AI">a draft video</a> to show how the idea would work. This idea was not well received. It was alienating for the CCTV staff because they had not been involved in the development of the idea and it was more of an interesting technical project than something that addressed their needs. The news helicopter was also not a good fit for the organization&#8217;s culture and may have sent the wrong message to people interested in citizen journalism (after all, you do not need expensive and high tech tools like copters to be a citizen journalist). Additionally, CCTV did not have the technical capacity to use a copter in the future.</p>
<p>In the fourth stage, we worked with CCTV and NeighborMedia journalists to completely change our idea. We met right after the midterm review to discuss working on a collection of several lower-tech visibility projects like making coasters, stickers, and fliers. We also realized there was an important group of stakeholders we were including even less than the CCTV staff- the NeighborMedia journalists. We met with one of the NeighborMedia journalists, Saul Tannenbaum, during spring break and finally understood that the NeighborMedia journalists and CCTV staff represented different constituencies. We also realized the importance of greater collaboration. Up until that point, we had been talking to the CCTV staff about ideas, but it was presentation – not discussion or collaboration.</p>
<p>We set up a meeting after break with several NeighborMedia journalists, CCTV staff, and our team to discuss the problem and brainstorm ideas for our new project. The problem statement (that CCTV&#8217;s NeighborMedia program lacks visibility even though it is one of the few local news sources in the news desert of Cambridge) was fairly similar to our original problem statement, but the ideas were completely different. We continued to consider branding for greater visibility of NeighborMedia on stickers, but also included new ideas. These new ideas were things like campaigns around topics of public interest in Cambridge (like budgets, preservation of a mural, and homelessness) and low-tech ways to engage people in public spaces (like asking what people like most about living in Cambridge and allowing them to record their responses on a poster in a T station).</p>
<p>In the fifth stage, we tweaked our project yet again and finished working on it. After the Boston Marathon bombing, we realized that any public issue campaign would go ignored. In a discussion with the NeighborMedia journalists and CCTV staff, we suggested the <a href="http://www.cctvcambridge.org/cambridgeresponds%E2%80%9D">Cambridge Responds campaign</a>. Cambridge Responds is a series of articles by NeighborMedia journalists examining Cambridge&#8217;s perspective and role in the events around the Boston bombing.</p>
<p>Aside from Cambridge Responds, we made a few other things. We worked with NeighborMedia journalists and CCTV staff to create <a href="http://i.imgur.com/WboIwlg.jpg">a NeighborMedia logo/branding</a>. We turned this into a sticker. Additionally, we developed and discussed <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bcGBW8Tg8jMz9EAGQozbYMLiVbNMfn6xYflPs0nOP6A/edit">a list of suggestions for the NeighborMedia website</a> with the CCTV staff and NeighborMedia journalists. We also compiled <a href="https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B0k1thccTm5fbmQtTnB4MTIyYjA/edit?usp=sharing">a list of tools for storytelling in citizen journalism</a>. We passed this list of storytelling tools and the NeighborMedia stickers out at <a href="http://www.cctvcambridge.org/25thanniversarycampaign%E2%80%9D">CCTV&#8217;s 25th anniversary event</a>. Finally, we made <a href="https://docs.google.com/file/d/0BzzT3IYhPt7WMzlMblI0ajllaUE/edit?usp=sharing">a detailed guide on how to post NeighborMedia articles and use some of these tools</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Lessons Learned</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes the process is more important than the product. Even though our final products were ultimately not as cool or high-tech as our original idea, they ended up being more useful and sustainable for CCTV. And even though we spent most of our time this semester in meetings – at first, internally, and then increasingly with stakeholders from CCTV and NeighborMedia journalists – rather than actually creating products, the process was in the end beneficial to us as students interested in collaborative design. It was also constructive for the CCTV stakeholders and NM reporters, who said that they could not have organized the #CambridgeResponds campaign otherwise and also would not know how to use these new technologies.</p>
<p>In codesign, ideally there should be no distinction between the stakeholders and the team working on the project. We are all one team, not distinct groups working together. Functioning as one team keeps everyone on the same page when it comes to the problem, development of ideas, and the best solution. Once we started working as more of a team with the NeighborMedia journalists and CCTV staff, the process was much smoother and more productive for everyone involved.</p>
<p>And it is a really good that we discarded the drone idea. Otherwise we would be trying to fly drones over Cambridge after the bombing.</p>

			<p>The <a href="../../index.html">Spring 2013 Codesign Studio</a> is underway. Inspired by the profusion of hackathons, the frame of this semester’s course is to collaboratively design an inclusive pop-up event with our community partners. We meet weekly and both enrolled students and our partners participate in each class meeting. See our syllabus and growing resource list here: <a href="http://bit.ly/codesignstudio2013">http://bit.ly/codesignstudio2013</a>.</p>
<p>Our goals are:</p>
<ul>
<li>to work collaboratively to understand real-world civic media work and problems;</li>
<li>to think critically about the hackathon as a space for inclusive design and development;</li>
<li>to design and implement an alternative pop-up event informed by both our collaboration and our critique.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our partners are <strong>Clodagh Drummey and Susan Fleischmann with Cambridge Community Television (CCTV)</strong> and <strong>Corina McCarthy-Fadel, Diego Perez Lacera with Design Studio for Social Intervention (DS4SI)</strong>. I have had the opportunity to work with CCTV throughout this last year, and it’s great to be working with them in the classroom context as well. DS4SI is a new ally and partner and the more familiar I become with their work, the more I realize we share in common. Our class includes students from MIT, BU, Emerson, Harvard-Kennedy and Wellesley. This semester, <a href="http://mobile.mit.edu/people/federico/">Federico Casalegno</a> is instructing the studio and I am TAing together with <a href="http://civic.mit.edu/users/hidenise">Denise Cheng</a>.</p>
<p>Both organizations introduced their work to the studio:<br />

<strong>CCTV excerpt:</strong><br />
CCTV is a nationally recognized community media center that is the voice and vision of all Cambridge residents, businesses and organizations. CCTV provides tools and training to foster free speech and creative expression, and empowers producers and viewers to engage in local issues through media that is informative, engaging and as diverse as the community it serves.</p>
<p><strong>What is a critical issue or problem that you have that we’ll explore in this class?</strong><br />
<strong>Citizen Journalism:</strong> CCTV has a robust citizen journalism program – neighbormedia.org. The goal is to make this resource THE go-to place for Cambridge news and information. Issues: scaling the program up, promotion! We are planning a high profile half day or day long workshop on issues in citizen journalism: citizen journalism as social justice, legal, resources &amp; tools, etc. We hope to collaborate with the Berkman Center and the Digital Media Law Project at Harvard, and the Center for Civic Media and the Department of Urban Studies and Planning at MIT.</p>
<p><strong>DS4SI excerpt:</strong><br />
To briefly describe the project, we will be leading ds4si’s “Making Planning Processes Public in Upham’s Corner” project. This project is focused on researching past, present and outside planning processes relevant to the Upham’s Corner area. We will also be commissioning artists to create an interactive pop-up shop exhibit that highlights the different planning processes and planners pertinent to the area.</p>
<p><strong>What is a critical issue or problem that you have that we’ll explore in this class?</strong><br />
How to most effectively present the information we want to highlight in regards to planning processes in Uphams Corners, in a way that is immediately accessible, impactful, and interactive for the public, while using the most suitable technology available. Some current ideas include memory mapping and gentrification mapping and interactive public signage.</p>

<p><strong>Mission</strong><br />
CCTV is a nationally recognized community media center that is the voice and vision of all Cambridge residents, businesses and organizations. CCTV provides tools and training to foster free speech and creative expression, and empowers producers and viewers to engage in local issues through media that is informative, engaging and as diverse as the community it serves.</p>
<p><strong>History and Major Programs</strong><br />
Since opening our doors in 1988, CCTV has been named number one in the country an unprecedented 10 times by the national <a href="http://www.allcommunitymedia.org/">Alliance for Community Media</a>. CCTV is home to:<br />
• Three local cable channels featuring programming produced by Cambridge residents, arts and cultural organizations and City agencies<br />
• A dynamic, media-rich website, including the <a href="http://cctvcambridge.org/mediamap">Cambridge Media Map</a><br />
<a href="http://cctvcambridge.org/mediamap">(cctvcambridge.org/mediamap)</a> and the <a href="http://cambridgecalendar.org">Cambridge Calendar (cambridgecalendar.org)</a><br />
• Hands-on media production and technology workshops, providing access to emerging technologies and state-of-the-art media equipment<br />
• <a href="http://neighbormedia.org">NeighborMedia</a>: an innovative citizen journalism program offering coverage of local issues and events (<a href="http://neighbormedia.org">neighbormedia.org</a>)<br />
•the Cambridge Savings Bank and Google Computer Labs: hosting classes and public drop in hours for those without access to computers and the internet<br />
• Special outreach programs for seniors, immigrants low-income communities and non-profits<br />
• <a href="http://cctvcambridge.org/youth">The Youth Media Program</a>: a vibrant media arts and work experience program for underserved teens (<a href="http://cctvcambridge.org/youth">cctvcambridge.org/youth</a>)</p>
<p><strong>What are your assets &#8212; within the organization, what are your best skills, who are your partners in the community?</strong></p>
<p>In the shadow of the Boston media market, Cambridge, a city of over 100,000 residents, is not served by a daily newspaper, or by any commercial TV or radio stations. As a result, CCTV’s channels and website serve a critical role as a primary source of local information, a showcase for arts and culture and a forum for civic engagement. CCTV’s community channels reach over 35,000 homes in Cambridge that subscribe to cable television. Our website has a worldwide audience.</p>
<p>More than just a TV station, CCTV is a community media center where Cambridge residents and organizations create and share media about themselves and their community. After completing an extensive curriculum of media art and technology workshops, CCTV members produce thousands of hours of programming each year. Reflective of the city’s diversity, our members are predominantly lower income and vary in age and ethnicity.</p>
<p dir="ltr">CCTV also provides services to local non-profit organizations, documenting community events, hosting in studio discussions about social service programs, and producing Public Service Announcements.  CCTV’s efforts provided these organizations their only electronic link into the homes of their constituents.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Share some success stories: What do you do, what have you done and what are some current stories.</strong><br />
This year CCTV turns 25.  Something that was just an idea in 1988 has grown into a thriving media center that is recognized as the best of its kind in the country.   Over the years, CCTV has become a national model for utilizing new technologies to build community.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In 2011, to further expand our programs and services and better respond to the needs of the Cambridge community, CCTV relocated to a larger facility in Central Square.  CCTV’s new home is the place in our city where the best of community meets the latest in technology; an incubator where residents and organizations are at the controls, utilizing cutting edge media and technology to strengthen the fabric of our city.</p>
<p>In 2012, more than 650 individuals, organizations and businesses utilized CCTV’s services in our new facility.</p>
<p>We launched a collaboration with Google called Age Engage which engaged 65 seniors in one-to-one Internet training. Mary, a participant, explained,  &#8220;I like the one-to-one approach of the program for meeting me at my skill level and dealing with specific issues. It is the most useful adult education I&#8217;ve ever had.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Youth Media Program served more teens than ever&#8211; a diverse group of 45 young people.  One teen spoke of the program:  “The Youth Media Program is a good program because it teaches youth in Cambridge how to use media to express your feelings, and to get a point across that you want people to know about.”</p>
<p>We also provided more than 75 non-profit organizations technology training and production services. In 2013, we launched the Non-Profit Resource Center, which will offer more, specialized training and production serves geared to meet the needs of community organizations.</p>

<strong>Project</strong>:  <strong>Making Planning Processes Public in Upham&#8217;s Corner<br />
</strong><a id="internal-source-marker_0.48941389562350857" href="http://ds4si.org/">http://ds4si.org/</a><strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong>Description of the organization</strong><br />
Design Studio for Social Intervention, ds4si, is an artistic research and development outfit for the improvement of civil society and everyday life. We are situated at the intersections of design thinking and practice, social justice and activism, public art and social practice and civic / popular engagement. We design and test social interventions with and on behalf of marginalized populations, controversies and ways of life. For us, social interventions are actions taken to reconfigure social habits, unspoken agreements or arrangements that, prior to the intervention, add to the durability and normalcy of a social problem. We focus on social interventions because we believe they can affect both formal hierarchical systems like school systems and complex nonlinear systems like cultures.</p>
<p>To briefly describe the project, we will be leading ds4si&#8217;s &#8220;Making Planning Processes Public in Upham&#8217;s Corner&#8221; project. This project is focused on researching past, present and outside planning processes relevant to the Upham&#8217;s Corner area. We will also be commissioning artists to create an interactive pop-up shop exhibit that highlights the different planning processes and planners pertinent to the area.</p>
<p><strong>What are your assets &#8212; within the organization, what are your best skills, who are your partners in the community?</strong></p>
<p>Some of our assets within the organization include our methodology, which allows for creative and experimental ways to tackle social problems without relying on or ignoring existing methods. Our space is a place of convergence for artists, activists, academics, and organizers to think and create collectively. One of our strongest skills is that, when tackling new problems we do so in a non-linear fashion, which pushes us to examine the multiplicity of factors that may affect a situation. Our partners include the following: The City School, Dudley Street Neighborhood Initiative, Uphams Corner Main Street, The Food Project, ArtPlace, Boston Youth Organizing Project, Gallery Basquiat, Etc. For further information please visit <a href="http://ds4si.org/storage/ds4si_whatwedo.pdf">http://ds4si.org/storage/ds4si_whatwedo.pdf</a></p>
<p><strong>Share some success stories: What do you do, what have you done and what are some current stories ? Past successes include:</strong></p>
<p><strong>THE PUBLIC KITCHEN</strong><br />
<a href="http://ds4si.org/public-kitchen/">http://ds4si.org/public-kitchen/</a><br />
The Public Kitchen is a creative R &amp; D project aimed at problematizing the current degradation (and subsequent privatization) of all things public—schools, parks, water,<br />
hospitals, etc. Going in the opposite direction, the Public Kitchen will raise awareness of how making things public can increase access to affordable healthy foods and vibrant social communities. For activists taking on food justice issues, it also provides both a demonstration of a unique intervention and valuable data about what people desire in food and sociality.</p>
<p><strong>FLIP IT</strong><br />
<a href="http://ds4si.org/lets-flip-it">http://ds4si.org/lets-flip-it</a><br />
When Boston youth organizers wanted help taking on the social violence that was sweeping their communities and causing a spike in youth murders, we worked with them to design the “Let’s Flip It” campaign. Based on a deep exploration of the Five S’s, LFI took the symbol of the fitted cap (used by many youth to rep their blocks and therefore the cause of much friction between gangs and crews), and created a youth-to-youth campaign using a blank white fitted.<br />
Combined with logo pins and flyers, LFI aimed to address the problem at the scale of the city, creating a direct way for youth to communicate with each other that it was time to “flip Boston”, to stop repping their blocks and start repping living.</p>
<p><strong>What is a critical issue or problem that you have that we’ll explore in this class?</strong></p>
<p>How to most effectively present the information we want to highlight in regards to planning processes in Uphams Corners, in a way that is immediately accessible, impactful, and interactive for the public, while using the most suitable technology available. Some current ideas include memory mapping and gentrification mapping and interactive public signage.</p>

			<p>During the course Jenny facilitated a workshop where we tested different tools for collaborative interviews and documentary film making. I interviewed Charlie, who spoke about why he found co-design useful in his work. I lost the original sound clip (so sorry Charlie) but the following is a picture from that day and my reflections on Charlie&#8217;s comments.</p>

<p><a href="http://codesign.brownbag.me/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Conversation-with-charlie.m4a">Conversation with Charlie</a></p>
<p>Looking back at this interview and the entire course as I worked with Rogelio and Sujata on the Final Report, I realized that my biggest learning from the course was the codesign should not only involve a participatory design process, but should also focus on building the capacity of the community partner to participate before even starting the design process. We often assume that people want to participate and even when they do want to participate that they have the capacity to do so. However our conversations in class and with Cara, our community partner, taught me that we have to build a supportive framework for participation if we truly want to work collaboratively with a community.</p>
<p>Here is a sound clip I recorded based on these final observations.</p>

<p>A big thanks to the entire codesign class for all the rich conversations and sincere feedback!</p>

			<p>Last Friday, Rogelio and I asked Cara if we could meet her for lunch as we had a gift we wanted to give her on behalf of the team.  We decided to go to the farmer&#8217;s market, which is now running in Copley Square on Fridays.  It was nice just to stroll around together and we could talk about whatever was on our mind.  What we realized is that we have a really good trusting relationship with Cara and we assume that some of that natural trust was built out of the collaborative processes which were used throughout the semester. Furthermore, even though there was some element of closure in this meeting, we realized that Cara sees us as integral to the campaign after she asked if we could represent the campaign at an upcoming event with an organization that might help support the campaign by increasing its visibility.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Rogelio and I were not available for that meeting but may help her with similar activities in the near future.</p>
<p>Below is a picture of the farmer&#8217;s market in Copley Square.</p>
