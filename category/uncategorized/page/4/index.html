			<p><strong>Expanding the Notion of Public Good: A Popular Education WeChat Strategy for Chinese Progressive Association (CPA) Boston</strong></p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>We are creating educational content for progressive Chinese American community organizations to distribute on WeChat to broaden their base and to counter right-wing Chinese narratives.</p>
<p>Abstract:</p>
<p>The Chinatown Progressive Association (CPA) organizes working-class Chinese/Chinese Americans in Boston around issues of housing and workers rights. Civic action and political education around economic and racial justice are embedded in their organizing model.</p>
<p>Through discussions over the course of March and April with CPA staff, our co-design project landed on the form of educational content expanding the notion of the public good, and on the issue of right-wing organizing on WeChat, a Chinese social media platform that has been utilized extensively by conservative Chinese activists.</p>
<p>To address misinformation spread by right-wing Chinese Americans, there must be a more diverse range of content available on the WeChat platform. We are designing shareable WeChat content that can open up easily within a group chat and that can be integrated into a subscription account post. This collection of images will also be given to CPA in larger file format so that they can also be used as posters. The first topic we chose was data disaggregation, one of the most contested issues on WeChat currently.</p>
<p>Case study and Presentation available on request.</p>

<p><em>Am I Next? </em>is a short documentary focusing on student opinions and activism in Billerica, MA around the topic of school gun violence.</p>
<p><strong>The goal of the documentary is to provide Billerica’s high school students a space to have their voices heard, advance their knowledge of video production, and explore different viewpoints on gun violence.</strong></p>
<p>Group members of this project performed interviews with Billerica Memorial High School students in group and individual settings as well as researched local and national reactions to school gun violence. Our project collaborators also filmed the BMHS student walkout, researched the history of school gun violence in the U.S., and compiled related social media posts and news footage to enhance the audience’s understanding of the topic. Through this project, we hope to create dialogue between students and community members about how different populations in our society react to gun violence in school settings and how we can move forward to ensure these events don’t continue to occur.</p>

			<p>Hi everyone!</p>
<p>Sadly I won&#8217;t be in clas on Wednesday &#8212; right now I&#8217;m in the Balkans, traveling for school and learning about the history of former Yugoslavia. Very interesting stuff.</p>
<p>Here is a link to our case study, though Mallory might still be editting it. https://docs.google.com/document/d/1n57MXsrNwvklRAZA5IOBPJppS5EsI4A5Rq88ecjqNOc/edit?usp=drivesdk</p>
<p>Mallory is also doing the powerpoint presentation, so I don&#8217;t have a link for that yet (THANK YOU MALLORY!). I wanted to post something because I&#8217;m worried I won&#8217;t have internet tomorrow.</p>
<p>A big reflection I&#8217;m having is about how do we make transformational change in such a short period of time? I think that our project (hopefully) started to sow the seeds for some ideas for transformational change. I think of transformational change as fundmentally altering the way we think about something, and therefore how we approach problem solving and implementing our ideas for solving the problem. The short term nature of the project reminds me that big changes take a long time to happen. If I want to keep doing co-design inspired work and make transformational change, I might need to re-think what transformational change look like or how I measure whether or not it&#8217;s happening&#8230;Right now I measure whether or not we changed how we think about things, and therefore changed how we approach problem solving and implementing our problem solving ideas by evaluating whether or not the idea we implement feels risky but is successful. I think my evaluation metric for transformational change is the riskiness of the idea and implementation because I think that something really transformational shouldn&#8217;t already exist&#8230;and it needs to be successful otherwise it wasn&#8217;t a good transofrmational change! But to see this kind of change, it seems impossible without trial and error, which takes time, money, and relationhips built on trust. Iam thinking about how to maximize those three things in a world where sometimes they are limited. And trying to think about whether I need a new definition or evaluation tool for transformational change.</p>
<p>Really excited to hear how the presentations go. i wish I could tune in, but I am 7 hours ahead, so class will be from 2-5am in Croatian time 🙂</p>

<p dir="ltr">The meeting was held in Mandarin and Cantonese, with some simultaneous interpretation into English. CPA staff and members described their experiences with Wechat. Generally, the Chinese-speakers were more knowledgeable about Wechat and were involved in more private group chats. Mrs. Tang, the most knowledgeable about Chinatown WeChat groups, noted how whenever she disagreed with right-wing opinions in group chats, she would feel attacked. Fiona, the workers center organizer, expressed the need to create much more educational Wechat content to be able to respond to the daily articles by right-wing Chinese. Lydia and Karen, former and current executive directors of CPA, discussed the need for long-term planning for content-creation and gave us feedback for utilizing existing material such as the Asian American Racial Justice Toolkit created by CPA San Francisco.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Through the workshop, we were able to get quick feedback on our Wechat infographic prototype and we were able to crowdsource a list of future content topics and resources to continue making content. We were also able to connect with others in the Chinese American activist community who are organizing a more extensive effort around utilizing Wechat. Our next steps include 1) continuing to create content and to share with our new Wechat group for further feedback, and 2) conducting research on right-wing Chinese WeChat mobilization strategies.</p>

			<p dir="ltr">This first feedback session was a small group of people very familiar with The Griot. We selected these participants because they know the museum well and we thought a first round workshop would be a productive way to ensure that our new twists on the Griot story is true to A.) what people love about The Griot and B.) accurate. We had two attendees join us, and though video chat, and though our group was small, the conversation was incredibly rich and we could have even used more time. The intimate nature of the workshop allowed us to review each section of the proposed crowdfunding campaign page in detail.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Our <a href="https://codesign.mit.edu/category/uncategorized/page/4/Workshop&#32;Agenda/Guide">agenda</a> took us through each section of the early <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rR7bOrqpbnIV1F49okMsKwSAIa5zdDHM/view?usp=sharing">draft campaign page</a> where we inquired from our experts to share elements they would add, take away, or definitely keep. We also gathered their immediate reactions to language and photo as well as minute details such as specific tweaks in language. The group setting allowed for our participants to react to each other and build off of one another. Through our screen share video chat, we were all able to view the same elements at the same time, which allowed for a very focused conversation.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="../../../../wp-content/uploads/2018/04/IMG_5434.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2977" alt="" src="../../../../wp-content/uploads/2018/04/IMG_5434-300x225.jpg" width="300" height="225" srcset="../../../../wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/IMG_5434-300x225.jpg 300w, ../../../../wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/IMG_5434-1024x768.jpg 1024w, ../../../../wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/IMG_5434-400x300.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p dir="ltr">This session was incredibly helpful. Key takeaways included:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">Because our point person for the project is the sole employee of the museum, her inner circle (including those at the workshop and others) truly are the experts of the museum. They have been key to gaining insight into The Griot and it’s context, as well as refining our campaign</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">A request for language to not appear imploring or to highlight deficiency, but rather to orient our fundraising campaign around ‘opportunity’ and positive language</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">The inner circle is eager to connect us to other resources and supporters</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">The message of the campaign can be further focused</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">There is a need to balance the story as its always been told with a new way of telling the story to a new audience</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">There is a need to balance meticulous accuracy and audience-specific linguistic appeals in the campaign. This is always the fine dance of marketing, and an important balance for us to strike in this project</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">We should embrace the justice platform of the institution through the crowdfunding campaign</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">We will ensure that in our next workshop we are testing these changes with a group who is unfamiliar with The Griot, to ensure that this story resonates with folks outside of The Griot’s inner circle. We are also considering testing two different messages to see what is resonating more with people unfamiliar with the museum. We are also adjusting out language to be more opportunity-oriented, as well as language that centers around the justice-based ethos of the museum and its inner circle.</p>

			<p dir="ltr">I held a workshop with two of my codesigners/high school video club members to work out the structure of the school gun violence documentary as well as to discuss what material we had and what we still needed to get. The workshop was extremely productive! It resulted not only in a clearly defined “flow” for the film, but also provided a space to parse out the aesthetic of the film. We discussed possible graphics, camera shots, and how we can use audio to convey transitions between the various sections of the piece.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In order to allow space for my students to voice their opinions about where they see the direction of the film going, I made sure to structure the workshop in a way that would be more fluid than rigid. <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nhUUIH8F-GsiGFDhYW6JeJOX3lx0zEBNSlf1zhOjK5U/edit?usp=sharing">Although the workshop guide divides out the workshop into three sections</a>, the actual workshop I facilitated was more of an organic conversation and planning session rather than a rigidly timed workshop.</p>
<p>Going forward, we will be meeting twice a week along with regular check ins to make sure we stay on task. The two students will schedule additional interviews, gather footage from other local and national protests, assist with filming B roll, and edit together footage. We will continue to define roles as the process continues and make this experience as collaborative as possible. I’m very excited to see how all this turns out!</p>

			<p>Mallory and I conducted a video conference call workshop with some of the Griot&#8217;s key fans.  We asked them to review the photos, text, and layout we had drafted for the GoFundMe page and I am so grateful for their critical feedback!  I was worried that people would be shy about feedback.  People in our workshop definitely still prefaced any negative feedback with lots of positive caveats and support, but I loved that they did not hold back on giving us meaningful suggestions and insights for improvement.</p>
<p><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ID0H7MvRjl6ZdyDrNTAa3a0zz7YuBXnrKOuOeX1VWL0">Here&#8217;s a link to our Workshop Agenda</a>.  We followed it for the most part, but definitely made some changes on the fly and didn&#8217;t send out the website ahead of time.</p>
<p>We learned that our workshop attendees wanted the GoFundMe to have a more narrative flow, include more about the wonderful founder (Lois) who they all love, and wanted to think about how to shape the language of the GoFundMe to be urgent yet positive.  We also got feedback about the <em>feel</em> of the museum.  Our attendees talked about the immersive experience being in the museum, how the museum generates empathy, how the museum has taught them so much.  This was really amazing for me as someone who&#8217;s never been to the museum.  I feel like I got to understand what makes this museum so special to so many people, and what makes it unique.  Which is perfect for building out content for a crowdfunding campaign!  It was reinvigorating to be with a group of people who believe in the museum, believe in Lois, and believe in our project so much.</p>
<p>In addition to getting this critical feedback, I was inspired by how the workshop accomplished other goals that I wasn&#8217;t completely expecting.  Our workshop participants didn&#8217;t know each other, despite both being loyal fans of the museum and Lois &#8212; so the workshop gave us an opportunity to connect two people who share a passion and build relationship between them.  We asked our workshop participants to suggest names of people they would forward the campaign to &#8212; so the workshop gave us an opportunity to drum up excitement and support, getting key fans excited about the forthcoming opportunity to share our campaign.  Moving forward, I am eager to work to make sure that our co-designers <span style="text-decoration: underline">know</span> that they are co-designers.  I want all these people who have built this campaign with us to feel like they own it and its their success when (hopefully) the Griot reaches its fundraising goals.</p>

			<p>The project I had in mind at the beginning of the codesign studio has completely transformed, however, it has definitely changed for the better. Initially, I had hoped to do a project that would engage students in town government and help them understand what articles/issues are discussed at town government meetings. Primarily, though, the goal was to allow a space where students could not only learn about local processes, but also voice concerns they have as citizens of Billerica.</p>
<p>The project quickly shifted after the Parkland shooting. Many of the high school students I work with at BATV were interested in discussing gun violence and gaining a better understanding about this topic. It became clear that they were looking for a space to talk about their opinions and feelings around gun violence and adult responses to school shootings. This has since developed into a short documentary film featuring footage from the walkout BMHS students did in March as well as a variety of interviews, social media posts, and other forms of student discussions. Several students have also become heavily involved in the planning process and will be assisting with editing as well.</p>
<p>Although the subject matter of the project has shifted, the general concept of the project has remained the same: engaging Billerica youth in local issues and allowing them space to be heard. I am excited to see where the documentary goes and how this process can not only benefit my understanding of codesign, but also benefit the students I’m working with as well.</p>
<p>In terms of lingering questions, I continue to struggle with how to get more students involved in the project (particularly walkout organizers) and how I can best support the growth of this documentary without stepping on the toes of the students I&#8217;m working with.</p>

			<p>Going into class, I came in with a relatively straightforward learning goal: I wanted to learn more about communities and how they are formed, sustained, and modified. Communities are easier identified than defined, which makes me want to learn or explore these the social processes that shape communities in more depth and detail.</p>
<p>Over the course of the semester, I feel that I&#8217;ve learned about design thinking tools, observation techniques, writing project proposals, and working with organizations. Perhaps through the application of these practical tools in upcoming workshops and design project will help me meet the relatively abstract, theory-driven learning goal I&#8217;ve set out for myself.</p>
