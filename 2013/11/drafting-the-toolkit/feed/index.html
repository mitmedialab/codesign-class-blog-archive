					<description><![CDATA[Hello CLVU team,
Looking forward to seeing the toolkit and playing these games next week.

Regarding your Case Study Draft here, you must also write the narrative of the project -- following the Case Study template.  The toolkit is a key component of your project outputs, but as drafted above, is not telling the narrative of your work together in the way that you&#039;re required to.

Let us know if you have any questions about this.
