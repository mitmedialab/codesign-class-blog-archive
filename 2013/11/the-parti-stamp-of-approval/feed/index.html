					<description><![CDATA[In addition to Willow&#039;s points, below are my comments and questions:

- First of all, I want to commend you guys on finalizing a concrete idea.  The PARTI addresses in a manageable way a lot of the needs Urbano expressed early on, and my favorite part is the suitcase! So creative!  Also, you present a really clever way for staying in touch with people who contribute to the PARTI by collecting their e-mails and twitters - I like that you are aiming to create a feedback loop.

- Speaking of the suitcase, I want to push you guys to think about this more.  How does the design of the suitcase reflect the overall purpose of the project?  What does the suitcase say about the Urbano Project? What message does it send?  I think the way the suitcase is treated can give a lot of personality to your project, so be deliberate and purposeful with it.

- You mention social media networks and posting the contributions to Facebook and Twitter.  I have two thoughts about this:

1) I would like to see an overall social media strategy explained and thought out for the PARTI.  Does every contribution get FBed and tweeted?  Who are you connecting with on these channels?  What are you trying to achieve with social media? How will you facilitate dialogue with the PARTI through social media?

2) Platforms such as Flickr, Pinterest, Vojo, etc. have a nice gallery quality that allows viewers to easily see images.  I would encourage you to use this type of platform to showcase the contributions otherwise they will be hard to appreciate from just Facebook and Twitter.

- I think it would be amazing if you could come up with a way to get audio recording into the PARTI contributions.  This way people can leave voice stories or sounds, even video, which would add a whole new dimension to the content. Is it possible to do this at all?

- I am not clear on how the Urbano Project is using the PARTI contributions.  Once they are collected and exhibited on some site/platform, then what?  Are the students using them to make art? Is the idea for people&#039;s dreams of their city to just be accessible on the Internet? Be explicit about the goals.  I know you are trying to broaden audience engagement, but then what?

- Can people still contribute if they are not in front of the PARTI?  What is the strategy for that?

I am looking forward to learning more about the video that people watch - that will be really interesting and telling!

Let me know if you have any questions!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I really like how this is asking people to add in their stories. Will participants see what others have created before or after their exposure to the 1-2 minute video? Either is fine, but it might change what the output is. Seeing things after allows each person to lend their unique, uninterrupted perspective; seeing other works before allows people to weave a story together.]]></description>
