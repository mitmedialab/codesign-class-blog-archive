					<description><![CDATA[Hey Urbano team!  Good job of getting more specific about your design and imagined situations where this will be used.  

You mention, &quot;we are considering many different forms of interaction with users, such as video, audio, and visual.&quot;  One way to help you make choices about interaction design -- what kinds of media you will show, how people will interact with it is to create Persona and User Stories.

I have written up this guide for creating Persona and User Stories -- you could do this in your project team or even with your team and more folks from Urbano.

Let me know if there are any points that are unclear: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1d2uty-RWaPMY_LNr0hRVcG5Ll8bXJEe0FvcwlswnPE8/edit?usp=sharing
