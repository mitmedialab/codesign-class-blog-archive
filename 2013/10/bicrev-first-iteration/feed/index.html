					<description><![CDATA[hi BIC team!

Good job of getting more concrete about design. It&#039;s good to see this storyboard and the sketch of your logic tree.  One lesson from NDNS was that the voice tree was actually quite difficult to navigate.  A way to really push yourselves beyond the model of NDNS and to think about a tree that serves your callers as well as possible would be to draw a few more voice trees.  If you try to draw 3 wildly different versions, you&#039;ll make yourselves think more creatively about how to solve the problem of moving between audio content in a streamlined way.

Cheers,
Bex]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey BIC Team!

Here&#039;s some feedback on your latest blog post and draft proposal from Oct 14. I&#039;m sharing feedback based on the Urbano methodology below. Let me know if I can clarify anything for you.
Cheers,

Bex

Clarify

- Clarify which parts of this proposal you will pursue for this class.

- Clarify how the parts of your team will work together as language in the MOU. See other groups&#039; MOUs and the examples we shared for guidance.

Value

- All of your proposals demonstrate building on the prior work that REV- has done  to date sharing info so that domestic workers are more aware of their new rights and employees also are aware of new laws to comply with.

Concern

- One issue REV- has reflected on regarding the Nanny Hotline first implemented in NYC, was the difficulty in spreading the word about the hotline. Can you explain a bit about the ways that people will be sharing this version of the hotline and how the in-person organizing strategy will include this channel of information?

Suggestions

- Include REV- and NuLawLab as partners listed in the &quot;Partner Mission&quot; area so we know more about the team and why people are participating.]]></description>
