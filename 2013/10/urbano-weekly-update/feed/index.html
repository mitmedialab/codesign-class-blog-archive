					<description><![CDATA[Howdy! Glad to see things being worked on, and the update is useful to see things progressing. If you allow commenting abilities to willow dot bl00 at gmail, I will give some feedback on your MOU in detail.

Your asks from them are solid and clear - I assume your offers to them will become more defined after you meet. Looking forward to seeing how it develops!]]></description>
