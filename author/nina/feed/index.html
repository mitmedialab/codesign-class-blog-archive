								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Our group worked primarily over the computer and communicated over email. We split up the work to in terms of what people were most interested in doing. We split the group up essentially into who would work on the ChatBot and who would work on the Twitter piece. In the future I think it would be important to meet in person all together at least once. This is an important step in the process because brainstorming is an integral part of the idea development and it is useful to get immediate feedback from each other.</p>

-->Design is part of capitalist movement. In order to be taken seriously (i.e.not just another capitalist value) it must create set of values for itself so it will be taken seriously.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Critical Design: “Social, cultural, and ethical implications of design objects in practice.” Objects that get the user to think.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Associative Design: “Artistic speculation &gt; design for production”, straightforward, but objects = conceptual.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Speculative Design: Science and tech in design. Thinking about ethics of science. Design = syn bio, robotics, etc. “Process of science considered part of the design process”</p>

-->Hi all!</p>
<p>My name is Nina, I&#8217;m 17 and am currently enrolled as a student at NuVu which is an innovative engineering program for middle and high school students. This year I am taking a gap year between junior and senior year of high school to go to NuVu. I decided to do that because NuVu is a really good fit for my interests. I&#8217;m interested in design, engineering, tech, and biology. I also intern at Planned Parenthood and teach sex Ed in middle and high schools around the Boston area. I&#8217;m also really into freestyle skiing and I compete in that in the winter and train throughout the year.</p>
<p>One example of youth advocacy that I find really inspiring is an organization called Camions of Care. Camions of Care is an organization that&#8217;s goal is to globally distribute menstrual products to people in need. They also work to destigmatize periods in general and celebrate menstrual hygiene and change the idea that periods are something to be ashamed of.</p>
