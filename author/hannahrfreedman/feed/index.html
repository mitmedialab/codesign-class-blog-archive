<p>Hi all, good to meet you last week. My name is Hannah and I&#8217;m a data visualization and mapping freelancer and organizer. In my work I support non-profits, journalists, and organizers in using data to better understand their research and tell compelling stories about it. I&#8217;ve worked in reproductive justice//abortion access, urban planning and community development, and Palestinian solidarity and anti-militarization. In my unpaid projects I organize with an anti-police and anti-surveillance collective in Boston, support a rapid response anti-doxxing crew, and organize community safety systems in my Jewish community. I live in a beautiful lil coop house and like to knit and care for my sun-starved plants. </p>



<p>I&#8217;m in this class to fight against the lonely freelancer life and work with some other brilliant folks in the service of movements that matter to me. Some ideas bouncing around include creating a secure intake system to level up the anti-doxxing work or designing workshops/events to support in collecting community testimony about experiences with the Boston police. The creative archival work celebrating 40 years of Wake Up the Earth also sounds interesting! I&#8217;m excited to hear what other folks are excited about and what we can create together this semester. </p>
