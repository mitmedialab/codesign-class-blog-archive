								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="magicdomid2942">Our group met this past Thursday to talk to Maria from UYC concerning our second iteration.   Bex was able to join into our Google hangout in order to answer any  questions Maria may have had concerning Vojo that we may not have been able to answers. Maria was largely concerned that the Vojo approach would produce just another website for UYC to manage and that Vojo would not be as appealing or accessible via mobile phone as opposed to an app.</div>
<div id="magicdomid2944"></div>
<div id="magicdomid2946">During our meeting, we all submitted quick sms messages to our Vojo test page. Maria expressed to us that she would rather the Vojo stories site be kept closed, and we were also concerned about how to incorporate the &#8220;survey&#8221; aspect of our project into our third project iteration. Bex suggested a number of other media projects and platforms for us to look into, such as mobilecommons. We were recommended to research the success of apps like the NYCLU Stop and Frisk App and to look into mobile survey tools.</div>
<div id="magicdomid2147"></div>
<div id="magicdomid2749">We have not been able to meet with Neo yet, but we hope to soon. We would like to see if it&#8217;s possible to create a lightweight app that could package Vojo, perhaps with a screen explaining how to send in a story, a screen explaining student rights, and a screen explaining how to get involved with UYC.</div>
<div id="magicdomid614"></div>
<div id="magicdomid2443">This upcoming Wednesday we will be leading the class discussion and presentation. Maria will be presenting on the history of the school-to-prison pipeline, as well as explain more about Urban Youth Collaborative as an organization. We will be leading a class workshop where we aim to have classmates discuss how to make Vojo suit our needs and perhaps ways to convey the stories once we&#8217;ve received them.</div>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Daniel: The discotech was an interesting experience for learning about surveillance and counter surveillance activism. Through talking with the numerous attendees there, I came out with a fresh perspective on how to approach social issues and think about these problems, such as surveillance, with a more critical and analytical mindset. I thought it was also interesting to see numerous artists who were there, also accomplished with their various social projects they are currently undertaking. During the hands on workshop, I especially found the analytical workshop for threatmodeling and the facepainting very informative. The face painting demo demonstrated the far reaches of technology, and how advanced facial recognition technology currently is. I believe the experience I gained at the DiscoTech will definitely allow me to be more aware of surveillance issues in the future.<br />
</br></p>
<div id="magicdomid30">Our workshop differed slightly from our original goals, in that it switched to more of a group discussion rather than a scenario hands-on activity. However, the information we gained was also incredibly valuable. We need to find out who exactly is the target audience of the UYC, in order to better understand how to frame our project. Ultimately, we should aim to capture both sides of the story in the schools in order to better allow student stories&#8217; to be told.</div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<p></br></p>
<div id="magicdomid32">Nushelle: I especially enjoyed <a title="/ep/profile/He4X2fyZMXg" href="https://surveillance.hackpad.com/ep/profile/He4X2fyZMXg">Saul Tannenbaum</a>&#8216;s short talk on the surveillance <i>of</i> MIT &#8211; it really brought home the face that surveillance is a lot closer than you think, and that often the reasons why you might be under surveillance are out of your control, and may sometimes have much more to do with chance connections.</div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<p></p>
<div id="magicdomid34">I also found the face-painting workshop to be surprisingly educational (in addition, of course, to being a lot of fun!). I admit that while I was excited about the face-painting, I wasn&#8217;t sure it would &#8216;work&#8217;. I think the beauty of it was that although we came in without a lot of knowledge as to how to get it done, we had such enthusiastic volunteers (<a title="/ep/profile/HAxWtEKWkUz" href="https://surveillance.hackpad.com/ep/profile/HAxWtEKWkUz">Elizabeth H Cho</a> offered her face to be experimented on first, and Bilal suggested we use Open CV to check our success rate) that the workshop grew organically. We realised that it wasn&#8217;t about the binary of whether one fooled the camera or not, but rather about the extent to which we could reduce the camera&#8217;s ability to detect a face. Elizabeth managed to fool the camera almost entirely, and we found that unusual hairstyles or accessories like scarves helped as well.</div>
<div></div>
<p></p>
<div id="magicdomid36">Apart from the great discussion we had about our project, Sasha also suggested that we work with UYC to create user stories to help us narrow down who are target audience is going to be, as nailing this down early will ensure we&#8217;re all on the same page, and will influence the content, form, aesthetics, and style of the final product. Basically, it&#8217;s a sentence of <i>who</i> (student/parent/teacher/local councillor/etc), <i>what</i> (what do they want to do) and <i>why</i> (why do they want to use the product?). Creating several of these stories, and then picking one, or at least ranking the order of importance of these users, helps clarify who we envision benefiting from the product.</div>
<div></div>
<p></p>
<div id="magicdomid38">E.g. As a <span style="text-decoration: underline">student</span><i>, </i>I want to <span style="text-decoration: underline">record my side of the story</span> so that <span style="text-decoration: underline">I can change how we are perceived</span><i>.</i></div>
<p></p>
<div></div>
<div id="magicdomid40">We hope to discuss possible user stories with Maria tomorrow.</div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<p></p>
<div id="magicdomid162">Elizabeth: I found this DiscoTech to be a great experience to learn and interact with people. A student from a small liberal arts college, I am more accustomed to discussing and learning with people my age with a single professor or lecturer present, so it was quite a new but exciting experience for me to engage in discussions and hands-on activities with people who are already in fields I might be interested in.</div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<p></p>
<div id="magicdomid1650">To begin, during our short talks our group immediately had a couple of responses from others on punitive practices in schools. One attendee suggested we look into the history of juvenile discipline, while another suggested we compare the ways in which student safety is executed in suburban schools as opposed to urban schools. I then participated, or rather listened in, on the &#8220;Surveillance and Public Art&#8221; DIY talk. People discussed some of their projects and ideas, like USB drops and surveillance camera- recorded plays. I find public art to be such a strong platform to generate consciousness on surveillance, and I hope to hear and even participate more with it.</div>
<div></div>
<p></p>
<div id="magicdomid2702">As Nushelle mentioned, our anti-face recognition was an unexpected hit. It was fun to discuss surveillance and face recognition software through an activity as simple as face-painting, we even got to talk and facepaint with a young girl (her mom also commented how nice it was to see lots of &#8220;girls&#8221; at the event!) Finally, we talked to Terry of Intelligent Mischief about storytelling methods, which I found very useful. I&#8217;m excited to use what we learned in our project.</div>
<div></div>

<p>Hello all! My name is Elizabeth Cho, but I more often go by first intitial and last name (Echo, but pronounced &#8220;eee cho&#8221;). I&#8217;m a sophomore at Wellesley College who just declared Cinema and Media Studies, or CAMS as we call it, as my major last semester. More recently, I&#8217;m beginning to strongly consider Computer Science as a potential minor, despite being one of those students who swore she wasn&#8217;t built for science or math (if anything, I&#8217;m beginning to realize that holding such a conviction held me back from considering CS-y things earlier). I wanted to take this class because I have a particular fascination with how people use media to connect on social, political and even emotional levels, and I wanted to see how I can implement this interest &#8220;irl&#8221;. I&#8217;m even more excited that this class can help me in considering what it is I&#8217;d like to do with the education I&#8217;m being given all while I can help a local organization. Though I consider myself to be very much at beginning level 1 in Civic Media, I hope that doesn&#8217;t scare off potential partners. As far as a quick, personal background, I&#8217;m originally from Chino, California, a suburb about 40 minutes south east of Los Angeles. My parents are both immigrants, my mother being from Nayarit, Mexico and my father being from Seoul, Korea. I&#8217;m the first in my family to attend a four-year college, and as such I feel a strong commitment and tie to my community and the southern California/ LA/ Inland Empire area.</p>
<p>Being Californian serves as a nice segue into the second point I&#8217;d like to mention in this post; that of The Day We Fight Back. I decided to partake in the event by emailing and calling my Californian representative and discussing the issue with my peers. All of this I did only after reading more about the background of the event, visiting some reddit threads, and skimming through the proposed bills. The emailing was, not surprisingly, effortless to do. I entered my name and zipcode and within a minute received a &#8220;Thank you for emailing!&#8221; from the organization. I decided afterwards to also call my representatives, and while I was easily able to leave messages with the staffers of Senator Barbara Boxer and my representative Gloria Negrete McLeod, Senator Diane Feinstein&#8217;s calling hours were suspiciously closed. Lastly, I found my conversations with other students to be especially revealing about the sentiment of surveillance and political action. My roommate, in particular, had mentioned that while she feels generally negative about the issue, she simply doesn&#8217;t feel a need to go so far as to download and learn software like Tor &#8220;just to hide that I looked at tumblr today.&#8221; I think that many people feel similarly concerning the idea of surveillance, and I think this class will bring to light the many different ways surveillance affects people and the ways we can react and counter that.</p>
