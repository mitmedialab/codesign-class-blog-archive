								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Based on comments we have received following our first product iteration. We have compiled a list of the three most important and general issues for us to consider in developing our 2nd iteration:</p>
<blockquote><p>1. Which parts of our proposal we will pursue in the time period of this class? Who will be collaborating, and how will each partner contribute (what inputs will be provided by who?)</p>
<p>2. How will this be promoted?</p>
<p>3. Logic Tree complexity</p></blockquote>
<p>After some initial discussion, though still not completely solidified, we have concluded that we will be aiming to produce 3 final products: A logic tree to be used in the implementation of the hotline, the characters and episode content for the hotline, and corresponding SMS message updates for subscribed users.  We will not, however, be focusing on the promotion and implementation of the hotline, as that would be project outside the scope of this class.  Lastly, one of our main goals in regards to  the hotline logic tree is to maximize simplicity. Through integration with SMS message updates, we hope to significantly remove any unnecessary confusion and complexity from the system.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATES:</strong></p>
<p>From reflections on possible paths toward failure. We have also come across issues involving confusion, offensiveness, relatability,  skepticism, in regards to our episodes and characters.  Hopefully, through collaboration with BIC and from user input we will eliminate these possible breaking points.  Overall, we felt this exercise was very enlightening, as it&#8217;s  easy to forget or ignore problems in each other&#8217;s designs, and being forced to acknowledge them will really help us create a sturdy and well thought-out product.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A bit late, but a visit well worth the wait: on Wednesday of last week the REV/BIC team came together at the Brazilian Immigrant Center located across the river in <a title="Allston" href="https://plus.google.com/113316069288308587521/about?gl=us&amp;hl=en" target="_blank">Allston</a>.  At around 6PM, the members of our team started to trickle into the second floor of BIC.  We, the MIT team, got to meet our Northeastern <a href="http://www.northeastern.edu/law/experience/leadership/lab/index.html" target="_blank">NuLawLab</a> counterparts for the first time, and they even brought us pizza!  It was clear that they were all just as excited to be a part of this project as we were.</p>
<p>After some introductions from each of our members, we got right to work with presentations from REV and BIC.  REV presented previous and current work, including <a href="http://www.studiorev.org/projects/nannyvan.htm" target="_blank">Nanny Van</a> and <a href="http://www.studiorev.org/projects/bibliobandido.htm" target="_blank">El Bibliobandido</a>, both of which served as inspiration for how the careful intertwining of art, technology, design, and social change can lead to incredible success.  Natalicia Tracy, executive director of BIC, followed, and she explained to us how BIC arrived at its involvement in the Massachusetts movement for domestic worker rights.</p>
<p>Naturally, after so much inspiration, the team had many questions.  We decided to write them all down on post-it notes, and place them on a wall :</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-family: Georgia, 'Bitstream Charter', serif">&#8211; Are we working on one project? Or several related projects?</span></p>
<p>&#8211; What are the most immediate steps to make?</p>
<p>&#8211; How do NuLawLab/MIT/domestic workers play a role in the design progress?</p>
<p>&#8211; Where is there the most room for creativity?</p></blockquote>
<p>While going through each question, we were able to clarify our goals both in concrete product form and in an idealogical sense.</p>
<p>As a collaboration we wanted to mimic the success of domestic worker hotline in New York, which created characters and used voice recordings to educate workers on their new rights.   The process in New York went a little like this:</p>
<div id="attachment_717" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://codesign.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/photo.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-717" class="size-medium wp-image-717" alt="In a /very/ simplified nutshell" src="http://codesign.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/photo-300x225.jpg" width="300" height="225" srcset="https://codesign.mit.edu/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/photo-300x225.jpg 300w, https://codesign.mit.edu/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/photo-400x300.jpg 400w, https://codesign.mit.edu/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/photo.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-717" class="wp-caption-text">In a /very/ simplified nutshell</p></div>
<p>Domestic workers (DWs) worked with REV to create &#8220;episodes&#8221; based on the new Bill of Rights (B.O.R.).  After some collaborative and iterative redacting, the audio pieces were recorded and the logic tree for the hotline was designed.  At MIT, the technology was finally implemented into a hotline!</p>
<p>As a collaborative group we wanted to work on a similar product that would work towards a few main goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>advancing domestic worker health and safety by both gathering and providing relevant information</li>
<li>engourage base-building and membership mobilizing</li>
<li>creating a detailed and malleable framework capable of producing and sustaining future projects elsewhere in the country</li>
<li>to galvanize new audiences and accelerate the growing movement for workers’ rights in MA and elsewhere</li>
</ul>
<p>Among the ideas thrown around during this meeting were:</p>
<ol>
<li>A Boston-based hotline that would help to spread safety information given to BIC by OSHA (Occupational Safety and Health Administration)</li>
<li>A &#8220;Guide to Culturally-Relevant Spread of Information&#8221;</li>
<li>Video clips to accompany OSHA safety guidelines</li>
<li>An interactive SMS component</li>
</ol>
<p>Of course, time did not let us fully develop each idea but I&#8217;m sure that with such a diverse group, they will solidify, consolidate, and strengthen organically over the coming weeks!</p>

<p>If anyone has suggestions, questions or general comments, please reply!</p>
