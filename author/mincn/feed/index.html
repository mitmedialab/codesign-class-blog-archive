								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m a member of <a href="http://agaric.com/">Agaric</a>, a worker-owned, cooperatively-run web development company which uses and contributes to Free Software, mostly <a href="https://www.drupal.org/agaric">Drupal</a> and Django.  I&#8217;m not a designer and look forward to improving my design-writ-large skills in this course.  I am not an MIT student or alum, having attended the the University of Massachusetts at Amherst studying journalism, economics, political science, and information technology and never completing a thesis called &#8220;Economics for a Better World&#8221;.  Still want to.</p>
<p>Justice, liberty, and the self-organization we need for both drive me in most of my involvements, including the support authentic news, especially public interest sources, such as <a href="http://binjonline.org/">Boston Institute for Non-profit Journalism</a> most recently.  I helped form a nonprofit organization called, by, and for, People Who Give a Damn.  Some time pretty soon <a title="People Who Give a Damn" href="http://pwgd.org/">PWGD</a> will finally get around to building tools to give equal access to, and control of, communication to everybody.</p>
<p>I can be found online most places as <a href="http://mlncn.withknown.com/">mlncn</a>.</p>
