								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi everyone! I&#8217;m Jade and I&#8217;m currently attending NuVu this winter term. I am a Junior in high school at Beaver Country Day School and am so excited to be apart of this Civic Media CoDesign class at a school as great as MIT. A little bit about me&#8230; I was born in Colombia but adopted at a young age and now live here (a little outside of Boston) My favorite sports to play are field hockey and softball. Although I do love frisbee, football and soccer to play for fun with friends. Music is my go to source for studying and just hanging out. I do not have a favorite type of music. As hard as it is to believe, every genre of music I have heard, I have liked. I want major in marine science or creative writing in college. Although, I have started to enjoy different types of design I&#8217;m doing at NuVu and in this class. I love young activists and empowering people in general so being in a class where we will all act as those people is amazing. It&#8217;s honestly pretty cool just being a high schooler and getting to join a college course.</p>
<p>This is Katherine Figueroa. She was 9 years old when she was pushed into a life of activism. Her parents were deported in a worksite raid leaving her on her own. She was on T.V trying to reach out the president at the time (Obama) &#8230; <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f641.png" alt="🙁" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> and asking for help immediately. She marched and rallied until her family was finally released.</p>
