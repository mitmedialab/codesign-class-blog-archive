								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi everyone! I&#8217;m Bridget. I&#8217;m a writer, editor, and digital marketing analyst. I&#8217;ve worked for myself and for others in operations research, public health, advocacy, and startuplandia. I like to investigate problems and I love to be surprised by what I find. I aspire to be a better human. I&#8217;m really looking forward to working with you this semester.</p>
<p>What I have to offer is my voice and perspective, as well as my experience with customer development interviews, user research, developmental editing, and measuring things.</p>
<p>We all have something to teach each other. Collaborative design appeals to me because I believe we can only build something that is truly essential, helpful, useful, interesting, and beautiful if we take an inclusive, empathetic approach to design.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m interested in lots of things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Justice and equity</li>
<li>Preserving public spaces for community participation and engagement, both in the physical world and online</li>
<li>Exploring biases inherent in selecting which data to measure</li>
<li>Visual art, mostly painting and drawing</li>
<li>Conceptual art, which I mostly practice by writing long grant proposals and not submitting them</li>
</ul>
<p>Until this point, friends have described me as a digital lurker, but I&#8217;ve recently found <a title="IndieWebCamp" href="https://indiewebcamp.com/" target="_blank">IndieWebCamp</a>, a project-movement that just might have inspired me to join the world again.</p>
<p>I satisfy my need to grow carrots and other things by gardening in a friendly community member&#8217;s yard that I found through <a title="My City Gardens" href="http://www.mycitygardens.com/" target="_blank">My City Gardens</a>, a project that connects people looking to share their yards with people looking for space to grow.</p>
