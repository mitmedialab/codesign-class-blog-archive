								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>During the course Jenny facilitated a workshop where we tested different tools for collaborative interviews and documentary film making. I interviewed Charlie, who spoke about why he found co-design useful in his work. I lost the original sound clip (so sorry Charlie) but the following is a picture from that day and my reflections on Charlie&#8217;s comments.</p>
<p><a href="http://codesign.brownbag.me/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/photo-1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-459" src="http://codesign.brownbag.me/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/photo-1-300x224.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="224" srcset="https://codesign.mit.edu/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/photo-1-300x224.jpg 300w, https://codesign.mit.edu/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/photo-1-1024x764.jpg 1024w, https://codesign.mit.edu/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/photo-1-401x300.jpg 401w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://codesign.brownbag.me/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Conversation-with-charlie.m4a">Conversation with Charlie</a></p>
<p>Looking back at this interview and the entire course as I worked with Rogelio and Sujata on the Final Report, I realized that my biggest learning from the course was the codesign should not only involve a participatory design process, but should also focus on building the capacity of the community partner to participate before even starting the design process. We often assume that people want to participate and even when they do want to participate that they have the capacity to do so. However our conversations in class and with Cara, our community partner, taught me that we have to build a supportive framework for participation if we truly want to work collaboratively with a community.</p>
<p>Here is a sound clip I recorded based on these final observations.</p>

<p>A big thanks to the entire codesign class for all the rich conversations and sincere feedback!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The goal of the Workshop was to collaboratively design the website and the online tools and strategies for the Press Pass TV campaign “Respect in Reporting”. They key focus of the workshop is to collectively decide how to best leverage the website so it can create an impact amongst youth, community members and in mainstream media.</p>
<p>The biggest setback was that neither Cara nor anyone else from the PPtv team and youth community could participate as they had their hands full dealing with internal organizational needs.</p>
<p>We decided to go ahead and test the workshop on ourselves.</p>
<p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, 'Nimbus Sans L', sans-serif"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-248" style="color: inherit;font: normal normal normal 15px/normal 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;font-style: inherit;font-weight: inherit;line-height: 1.625;border-style: solid;border-color: #dddddd;margin-top: 0.4em;height: auto;border-width: 1px;padding: 6px" src="http://codesign.brownbag.me/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/IMG_1352-300x224.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="224" srcset="https://codesign.mit.edu/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/IMG_1352-300x224.jpg 300w, https://codesign.mit.edu/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/IMG_1352-1024x764.jpg 1024w, https://codesign.mit.edu/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/IMG_1352-401x300.jpg 401w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></span></p>
<p>1. Creating Personas- Questioning Stereotypes about Youth</p>
<p><a href="http://codesign.brownbag.me/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/IMG_1356.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-249" style="color: inherit;font: normal normal normal 15px/normal 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;font-style: inherit;font-weight: inherit;line-height: 1.625;border-style: solid;border-color: #dddddd;margin-top: 0.4em;height: auto;border-width: 1px;padding: 6px" src="http://codesign.brownbag.me/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/IMG_1356-300x224.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="224" srcset="https://codesign.mit.edu/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/IMG_1356-300x224.jpg 300w, https://codesign.mit.edu/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/IMG_1356-1024x764.jpg 1024w, https://codesign.mit.edu/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/IMG_1356-401x300.jpg 401w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>2. Roleplay- Enacting Interactions between website and Youth Persona</p>
<p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, 'Nimbus Sans L', sans-serif"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-252" src="http://codesign.brownbag.me/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/IMG_1370-300x224.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="224" srcset="https://codesign.mit.edu/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/IMG_1370-300x224.jpg 300w, https://codesign.mit.edu/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/IMG_1370-1024x764.jpg 1024w, https://codesign.mit.edu/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/IMG_1370-401x300.jpg 401w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></span></p>
<p>3. Mockup of Website</p>
<p><a href="http://codesign.brownbag.me/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/IMG_1373.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-253" src="http://codesign.brownbag.me/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/IMG_1373-224x300.jpg" alt="" width="224" height="300" srcset="https://codesign.mit.edu/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/IMG_1373-224x300.jpg 224w, https://codesign.mit.edu/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/IMG_1373-764x1024.jpg 764w" sizes="(max-width: 224px) 100vw, 224px" /></a></p>
<p>4. Mock up of the first page of the website</p>
<p><a href="http://codesign.brownbag.me/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/IMG_1366.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-251" src="http://codesign.brownbag.me/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/IMG_1366-300x224.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="224" srcset="https://codesign.mit.edu/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/IMG_1366-300x224.jpg 300w, https://codesign.mit.edu/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/IMG_1366-1024x764.jpg 1024w, https://codesign.mit.edu/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/IMG_1366-401x300.jpg 401w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>5. Live Tweeting the workshop as a possible tool for distance collaboration</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Some Key Insights from Workshop</strong></p>
<p><strong>Interactions with Journalists</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Friendly tone, direct, professional</p>
<p>Focus on the fact that they have a lot of power and hence the ability to make a change.</p>
<p>Fast quick solution</p>
<p>Have to give more information for them to be truly vested in the project</p>
<p>Anonymity is important</p>
<p>Networking is important</p>
<p>Alternate opportunities to get involved other than directly through their companies.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Interactions with Youth</strong></p>
<p>They will ask a lot of questions</p>
<p>Their feelings about politics not clearly defined</p>
<p>Have a lot to say, forum for self-expression</p>
<p>Possible incentives based on virtual instant celebrity culture through websites like YouTube</p>
<p>Informal language</p>
<p>Need for strong, “cool” incentives</p>
<p><strong>Next Steps</strong></p>
<p>Make mock up of website that can be used at another workshop with community as the framework for designing the specific of the website.</p>
<p>Work with Cara to make the process more collaborative. Aim for a CoDesign workshop on community strategies.</p>
