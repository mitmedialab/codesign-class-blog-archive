								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kathy, Nina, Max and I finished and installed the project last night! I have lots of photos and video to share at class tonight. Within the night and morning, people walking past shared dozens of thoughts about Central and the photos we took. At some point today, someone stole the sharpies, which we expected to happen. I&#8217;m satisfied with the ephemeral nature of the project (and I&#8217;ve already noticed people bringing their own pens).</p>
<p>I&#8217;m currently working on getting the images and videos uploaded, but here are a few to start:</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve been very overloaded between work, NuVu, several migraines and two allergic reactions so I designated time today to get this post from last week done.</p>
<p>I interviewed Carlos Espinoza-Toro from the Jamaica Plain Neighborhood Development Corporation (JPNDC). <a title="Google Drive Folder with audio files" href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B-Mbw1qxCDOGX0ZBa1U1N0NyTDA" target="_blank">This is a link to my interview</a>.</p>
<p>Carlos and I talked about the JPNDC&#8217;s work with small business-owners and their families.The JPNDC does a lot of work with businesses facing eviction. Many businesses facing eviction/displacement don&#8217;t have the information they need to fight back against exploitative landlords. The JPNDC is able to support local families&#8217; businesses, which protects them and their community against interests that are trying to extract value from their land by kicking them out.</p>
<p>The JPNDC often acts as a connector, linking lawyers and community advocates (especially from groups like Harvard Legal Aid Bureau and City Life / Vida Urbana) with tenants or small family business-owners. This can level balance of power between landlords and residents, since landlords often begin with a greater understanding of the law. Even knowing that they are allowed to fight a displacement can be a significant improvement for residents or business-owners.</p>
<p>Carlos and I discussed the difference between the words gentrification and displacement as they relate to the people he works with. When people talk about gentrification, he said that they often focus on the new residents entering an area. He believes that it is important to consider the people that are pressured to leave an area as a result of economic, cultural and other changes that occur in tandem with new residents moving in. This concept, displacement, more directly refers to the people who have to leave.</p>
<p>Carlos talked about specific cases like a group of tenants whose landowner sent them a notice that their building had changed ownership and they were not sure of the significance of the document they were being asked to sign. This uncertainty was aggravated by the fact that the residents &#8220;didn&#8217;t speak English very well&#8230;they were afraid to sign it.&#8221; When they reached out to the JPNDC, they partnered with several other local organizations (like Egleston Square Main Streets, and City Life / Vida Urbana). The tenants didn&#8217;t have enough money (&gt;$5,000) so Carlos applied for a mini-grant from the Massachusetts Growth Capital Corporation so that the tenants would be able to pay for legal representation from Gabriel Mendoza. This let them negotiate with the new landlords for support towards their relocation. Carlos considered this a &#8220;great model for helping tenants going through the exact same situation.&#8221;</p>
<p>I interviewed Carlos a second time on video, at the JPNDC. This interview will be included in a film that I&#8217;m making, along with interviews with a number of other activists, professors and people fighting displacement.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m making this post very late because I&#8217;ve missed several classes due to migraines, conflicts and travel. I&#8217;m back from out of state and I&#8217;ll be at class tonight. I&#8217;m currently reviewing the readings so I can participate in class.</p>
<p>I completed my interview March 7 at 4:45PM with Rebecca Hornstein, a student at Cambridge Rindge and Latin School. Rebecca is a student at CRLS who works on the leadership of the feminism club at CRLS and has helped run youth zine workshops with an emphasis on social justice.</p>
<p>We met at a pizza place in Cambridge and talked about the Zine Club and CRLS&#8217; Feminism Club. <del>Here is the audio file:</del></p>
<p>Rebecca is under 18 years old, so I am currently arranging for her parents to sign off on the same permissions as she agreed to.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello everyone! I am Sam Daitzman, a student currently enrolled at NuVu Studio and Harvard&#8217;s Extension School Program. I left high school in under a month because I wanted a more relevant, modern education. I&#8217;m in my fourth year at NuVu Studio now, and I&#8217;ve worked on projects from fashion to prosthetic design to filmmaking and programming. I&#8217;ve organized a local youth civil rights group and a protest with the ACLU of Massachusetts, along with StudentRND&#8217;s CodeDay Boston event (which I am an evangelist for). I love the idea that design (in all media) can be guided by a moral and ethical purpose, rather than profit margins alone. I&#8217;m currently working an a completely reimagined treatment for Seasonal Affective Disorder at NuVu.</p>
<p>For my youth organization, I&#8217;m choosing Girls Who Code because I think it&#8217;s both an excellent example of effective youth activism with clear goals, but also because I see some excellent ways that the organization could be improved. They recently ran a series of campaigns that were overly focused on traditional notions of &#8220;biological sex&#8221; that detracted from the intersectional nature of sexism in the technology industry. They also tend to emphasize wage/career-centric benefits of programming over the experiential benefits or the empowerment of creation, which makes them less accessible to young women. Despite these issues, Girls Who Code has introduced programming to a generation of girls, many of whom have showed up to events like the one I organize in Boston.</p>
