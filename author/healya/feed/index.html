								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-6b365d23-5499-b6e0-89a2-345015af8fd7">This week, we conducted interviews with both current co-op members at Vida Verde and people who have employed house cleaning services of any company.</p>
<p dir="ltr">We conducted the Vida Verde interviews in two sessions. For the first session, Tais interviewed several cleaners. After these interviews, we refined some of our interview questions for the next round. For this round of  Vida Verde interviews, Emilie and Val interviewed two cleaners, as well as one co-op member who has been performing much of the coordinating and central communication duties of the co-op. Though we are still in the process of transcribing and processing the interviews, we are feeling more confident that the communications route is the right direction for our project, and that we are capable of designing and implementing tools that will help streamline and expedite the communications processes substantially.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Moving forward, Rachel wrote up some emails that we could potentially use to contact previous clients of Vida Verde. We are considering interviewing them to gain further insight into what areas of the co-op’s operations could be improved.</p>
<p>Additionally, Maya crafted a Facebook blast to start our search for potential interviewees who have employed house cleaning services. We have received several responses so far.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi all!</p>
<p>My name is Val Healy, and I&#8217;m a senior here at MIT. I&#8217;m majoring in Comparative Media Studies and minoring in Women&#8217;s and Gender Studies. Most of my research interests lie at the intersections of these two fields. Lately, I&#8217;ve been particularly interested in feminist technology studies&#8217; co-constructive model of gender and technology, textile-based data visualization, feminist cyborg theory (Haraway), educational media programming, queer theory, and the study of niche online communities. In my spare time, I can be found knitting, drinking tea, volunteering at my favorite summer camp, and cuddling chickens.</p>
<p>I decided to take this class for several reasons. For one, civic media is what drew me to major in Comparative Media Studies, and I worked with the Center for Civic Media last summer. Second, I have lived in co-ops for around four years now, and I&#8217;m very interested in learning more about cooperative businesses. Third, I love project-based classes, and I&#8217;m excited for the opportunity to build something (open source!) that will be used for good in the &#8220;real&#8221; world.</p>
<p>As for my technical skills, I have some programming experience (Python, Java, HTML, CSS, Javascript), some design experience, and lots of enthusiasm for learning new things!</p>
