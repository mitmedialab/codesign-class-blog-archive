<p><strong>Abstract: </strong>Rainbow is a public installation that tells the stories of about Cambridge residents and their history with the area. The goal of the project to highlight important issues mainly gentrification in and around Central Square. Using audio recordings and photography, this installation will help the voices of people who live in the area to be heard and shed light on how universities and businesses are changing Central Square and making the low-income life increasingly difficult.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A lot of effort as been made to make hackathons across the country more inclusive, equitable, and aligned with social justice. One important aspect of hackathon social justice is women&#8217;s rights and the need for equality in the tech industry. A typical hackathon will only have about 20% women which is very far off from a 50/50 goal. However, there have been efforts made and strategies layed out in order to achieve more equality like prioritizing women in hackathons, setting clear goals, identifying key roadblocks, and incorporating men. With the use of many of these strategies, people were able to organize many women focused tech events like the AngelHack in Gaza and future hackathons like the Women Who Code Hackathon which will be taking place in late July of 2017. The goal of these events is to obviously incorporate more women into hackathons, but the main strategy they use is to spread the word about gender equality and give women more confidence to work in the tech industry.</p>

<p>Last week I interviewed a fellow Beaver student named Joddy Nwankwo. She is a very active member of the feminist movement and she also does a lot of work with minorities. Over the past couple of months, she has attended the Presidential Inauguration Leadership Summit where she got the chance to see many important women around the world speak including Malala Yousafzai. She has also been interviewed by important news organizations like NBC and Teen Vogue. One key thing Joddy talked about in her interview was how people needed to take pride in who they are and their culture, and she also stressed the importance of fighting for what you believe in because if you don&#8217;t then you are falling under oppression. Something that Joddy really wanted to see in the future was to have more men be apart of the feminist movement because you can&#8217;t get anywhere without everyone&#8217;s support. Here is a link to the interview: <a title="Interview" href="https://soundcloud.com/alexander-jin-837384517/joddy-interview">https://soundcloud.com/alexander-jin-837384517/joddy-interview</a></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi, my name is Alex and I am fifteen year old high school student currently at Nuvu. I play a lot of sports like soccer and swimming however, swimming has become more of chore for me. I also recently just completed my first half marathon which is super exciting. Drawing is another one of my passions. Many members of my family are involved in art; my dad is a proffesor at the Central Academy of Fine Arts in Beijing, and my Granda is still an active painter. I, myself, have been drawing and working with art since I was three and I&#8217;ve had plenty of time to hone my skills. I recently found out that I also really like video editing. Sometimes I will spend my free time making funny vines, or just random silly videos which will keep me entertained for hours.</p>
<p>This is a link to the chinese democracy movement back in the 80s. I relate a lot to this because I am Chinese myself and my mom was actually at this protest: https://www.nonviolent-conflict.org/chinese-pro-democracy-movement-1987-1989/</p>
