<p>Hi everyone! As I&#8217;ve been working with the <a href="http://blackmothersbreastfeeding.org/">Black Mother&#8217;s Breastfeeding Association in Detroit</a>, we have been brainstorming ways that a &#8220;hackathon-style&#8221; event could support their work. During our last meeting, we&#8217;ve started brainstorming a distributed hackathon during <a href="http://blackbreastfeedingweek.org/">Black Breastfeeding Week</a> on August 25th-31st. While the Project Director is tinkering with the budget and exploring capacity, I started to research and collate distributed hackathon models to learn from here: http://bit.ly/distributedhackathons. If anyone knows of former events I can learn from or organizers I can connect with- I super appreciate the support. Thank you! </p>

<p>Hi all! My name is Rebecca and I am currently a Design Researcher at a biotech company. In recent years, I worked on the <a href="https://makethebreastpumpnotsuck.com">Make the Breast Pump Not Suck </a>project to catalyze equity-based innovation in post-partum healthcare. In the Fall, I&#8217;ll be starting my PhD in Human-Centered Design and Engineering at the University of Washington in Seattle, where I am exciting to continue co-design projects.</p>



<p>I am working with a community partner in Detroit, the Black Mother&#8217;s Breastfeeding Association on a &#8220;hackathon-style&#8221; design event for Black Breastfeeding Week in August 2019. The project will focus on consulting on the agenda and workshop design as well as supporting partnerships with the local design and tech community. </p>
