<p>TL;DR<br></p>



<p>I participated in Hack for Inclusion this weekend, and this is what I found to be successful and lacking from a <a href="http://designjusticenetwork.org/network-principles/">Design Justice</a> perspective:<br></p>



<p>What was successful:</p>



<ul><li>The event focused on using design to sustain and empower our communities.<ul><li>This was reflected in the <a href="http://www.mitbreakingthemold.com/challenges-2">challenges</a> that the Hackathon centered around.</li></ul></li><li>Everyone felt like an expert.<ul><li>On my team, everyone had meaningful ideas and skills to contribute. And this includes people we reached out to for interviews.</li></ul></li></ul>



<p>What could be more engaged:</p>



<ul><li>The event could enable more community-led and controlled outcomes.<ul><li>Apart from user interviews, we had no interaction with the actual community we were working on a solution for. And that was part of the issue &#8212; it felt as though we were building for a community rather than building with a community.</li></ul></li><li>The event could further encourage engaging with existing community solutions.<ul><li>During the research stage, the emphasis was completely on identifying problems rather than identifying existing solutions. During the prototyping stage, the emphasis seemed to be on building something new and novel. </li></ul></li><li>The event could place more emphasis on “change as emergent from an accountable, accessible, and collaborative process” rather than as a point at the end of a process.<ul><li>At the end of the hackathon, everyone presented their “solutions.” And while the organizers did encourage people to continue building and refining their solutions, there was no accountability otherwise.</li></ul></li></ul>



<hr class="wp-block-separator" />



<p>This past weekend, I participated in <a href="http://www.mitbreakingthemold.com/">Hack for Inclusion</a>. While I’ve done coding hackathons before, this was my first design hackathon. This hackathon was much more structured than ones I’ve done in the past, and it was also split into two days rather than being an overnight affair. Before the hackathon, we got to rank three questions we were most excited to tackle. I ended up being assigned to my first choice (which was not the case for everyone, so I’d say there were varying levels of enthusiasm on my team), which was <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1-oLz31Z0q65ERnEtX0WC0QLBl0hVlAbEUItF2NZu7OI">fostering inclusive commercial development in Somerville</a>. <br></p>



<p>Throughout the hackathon, all the teams were essentially guided through the “human-centered design” process, from user research to prototyping. For many steps of the process, we were given around 30 minutes to an hour (with the exception of prototyping, for which we had several hours). Our team was also assigned a mentor, who was a government employee working on development in the City of Somerville. During the process, she offered us feedback and gave us more context about Somerville from her own experiences of working with developers and business owners.<br></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/b2grIcXO2spsHntXWfIUwavFN-_5fu4LfOLfBf2UOQ2rZ2LZigZvhqMO3BNbbskQe73dDFSqmE9XSNp9b6ruPLIJTqtk53Xa6T68aWLf5KDmjbz4Mg0cfuHxrp3wse9NOPuvm50" alt="" /><figcaption><em>“Talk less, make more!”</em> 🤔</figcaption></figure>



<p>Each step of the design process felt very rushed, and my team definitely struggled to reach consensus at times. We all came from very different backgrounds career-wise (academia, law, consulting, non-profit) and identity-wise. I really appreciated getting to meet and collaborate with this diverse group, but the social friction was high at times. This reminded me of Lily Irani’s piece last week, on how hackathons often promote low-friction environments where you can quickly come to consensus and build, build, build. Funnily enough, every time our team took some time to come to a consensus, someone on my team tried to emphasize the “move fast and break things” mantra.<br></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/WiwkOIp7QPhGpNF7AMhuTODcmLQToPs6qn_v_NyGF4wEz0xMrHLx0CDHPLcYQFoCcLUf-lyZXYNqXCOgW7C2CH6p15aTiOpUg8CVlpNiv2aZ7Jkqq6uS4x6ltIUFo59_8D3Vfbo" alt="" /><figcaption>Brainstorming ideas with my team</figcaption></figure>



<p>Because we were given, by far, the most time to prototype, I think this led most teams, including ours, to focus on building a solution rather than taking time to understand the problem. I felt that the short hour we had to conduct and reflect user interviews was not enough (and I also took issue with the fact that we were encouraged to cold call business owners for interviews&#8230;1) do these business owners have time for spontaneous interviews on a Friday? 2) without prior relationships and trust building, how much information would they be willing to disclose? 3) there was no accountability in terms of us following up with them and sharing the potential solution we were working on). After some brainstorming and a lot of conversation, we realized how little time we had left, so we quickly decided to focus our solution on building a local community fund that could support minority business owners who need capital (and might be excluded from traditional forms of capital like bank loans) to grow their businesses. I thought this solution was promising, but we got caught up in the rush of feeling like we had to build a “product.” So we ended up framing the idea as a mobile app (which in retrospect, was a lazy solution that won out over other ideas we had for in-person relationship building between business owners and the city&#8230;and totally perpetuated technochauvinism). I distinctly remember someone from my team saying that we needed a “flashy” solution to impress the judges. 🤦🏻‍♀️So, yes, we ended up presenting this app called SomerFund:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/C4oTHnFuvhRlP47xyzmH2v0zgC6pj2EAzT-eKLqOGLqS-V-UIQQMD59rtLNzrTm0r5L1MQSq09fM3_SKpw1eERISlC891ewxi9h_DDSnYNlqCqNXn6vwOw6QmYmE1KWryQQF564" alt="" /><figcaption>SomerFund, a shiny new app</figcaption></figure>



<p>Overall, I learned a lot from this event. Was our solution a success? Not really. Did we really contribute meaningfully to minority business owners? No. Was this overall event successful? I think that will only become more clear after following up with teams in later months to see if any community relationships were sustained. But I was inspired by the ideas we had during our brainstorming process. It was great to meet people outside of MIT. I learned more about Somerville. And it was ultimately a good space to reflect on principles of design justice, and how (or whether) a short-term hackathon can lead to meaningful, community-led design solutions.<br></p>
