					<description><![CDATA[Hi Everyone!
My name is Aditi Jhaveri and I&#039;m an Junior at Wellesley College. I&#039;m an international student from Mumbai, India and am majoring in Women&#039;s and Gender Studies and Economics. I am a really talkative and fun person; I love eating and discovering new restaurants and baking. I am incredibly interested in print and graphic design, but would love to learn more about the process of &quot;design&quot; and creation. I come to this class as a student and an activist –– incredibly eager to learn and tap into the power of media and aware of the power of youth in social movements.

One groups that I most recently learned about was BAGLY - Boston Alliance of Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual and Transgender Youth. This group is a Massachusetts wide group that works towards social justice for LGBTQ youth. The organization focuses on providing &quot;safe spaces&quot; for LGBTQ youth to promote discussion and open communication with one another. Through leadership programs, the organization enables youth to understand the power dynamics and systems of oppression that exist both within and outside the LGBTQ &quot;community&quot;. The organization also advocates for social acceptance of diversity, and challenges institutional discrimination against LGBTQ youth.  

I find their work inspiriting because it is amazing to watch youth come together, for over thirty years, to fight systematic and social oppression. I also think it is incredible that this organization focuses on education and social awareness, not just legal reform.

This is a link to their website: http://www.bagly.org]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is really wonderful, I appreciate you sharing this life experience. Unlike the Aliens, we cannot be in two places at once, so we will always have to make hard choices. I believe you made the right choice, and it was made in the cooperative spirit. That is exactly how a coop works. A coop gives you the power to make the decisions best for all, even on the spot sometimes - we trust your judgment. The best case scenario is full communication about any date conflicts as early as possible, then you and the other members can make a solid plan. It is not like this type of situation would happen often.
In a coop, it is expected that we will all help to fill in for any member when they cannot be there. In a cooperative/real world this happens - one of the big differences in how this works in a corporation is this:

You would most likely be threatened with being fired//demoted or penalized in some way,  if you did not show up, and you would not have any opportunity to share your experience with your team. 

On the surface, this whole topic may not seem very important, but  if you look closely, this is the kind of situation that can stifle autonomy and creativity. It can even make smart people doubt themselves and feel guilty. When we are not encouraged to make important choices/decisions that can bring value to the group, we lose as a team. 

Imagine going into your corporate job and saying to your boss and team &quot;I want to go to an event that has major importance in my life and the things I am passionate about, I won&#039;t be able to be at the event the company is hosting next week&quot;.  
A cooperative approach would be to support the member by discussing ways to fill in or find a replacement for the workshop - they would also probably discuss how everyone could help by preparing any deliverables you would not be able to provide, in advance etc. Then they may go on to ask how they can enhance your trip and help you gain some positive things to share upon your return - they might even vote a cash bonus to help you enjoy your event more. Cooperation is great, who need stress?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[WordPress doesn&#039;t have collective post authorship and Jason doesn&#039;t seem to be available to update the post, so here&#039;s my update in a comment for now:

Ben&#039;s goal for this week was to follow up with some of the restaurants, grocery stores, and (via restaurants) building managers we visited and interviewed last week in order to reach the decision makers.  We have also entered our leads into CERO&#039;s lead, contact, and deal tracker, Base.  This, as has been CERO&#039;s experience, has proven much more difficult than talking with front-line staff and even managers, who, as we learned last week, don&#039;t know where the waste goes after they put it in bins.  Waiting on calls or e-mails back (or sufficient time to pass to follow up again) from Thomas at Morton&#039;s The Steakhouse, the head of procurement at Legal Seafoods corporate (locations will not divulge any information), Miguel at Harvest Coop, and most interestingly, the real estate and building management services behemoth JLL, which we know to compost at some locations at least and to talk up a good environmental sustainability game, http://www.us.jll.com/united-states/en-us/services/corporates]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Sounds like a great first meeting! I think for your 3rd possible idea, it will be really crucial to get in touch with groups that are working on something similar (coordination app for home cleaning coops). Specifically, it&#039;s worth writing and calling the folks from Si Se Puede, the Center for Family Life, and Coopify. Try to track down Emma Yorra (http://east.usworker.coop/users/emma-yorra), Si Se Puede Coop (http://www.wecandoit.coop), the team from Cornell Tech, and others who say they are in the testing stages of their app (http://community-wealth.org/content/coopify-new-platform-bringing-broad-based-ownership-your-smartphone). Ideally, they will either be open to Vida Verde beta testing, or will share their code!]]></description>
