								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A bit late, but a visit well worth the wait: on Wednesday of last week the REV/BIC team came together at the Brazilian Immigrant Center located across the river in <a title="Allston" href="https://plus.google.com/113316069288308587521/about?gl=us&amp;hl=en" target="_blank">Allston</a>.  At around 6PM, the members of our team started to trickle into the second floor of BIC.  We, the MIT team, got to meet our Northeastern <a href="http://www.northeastern.edu/law/experience/leadership/lab/index.html" target="_blank">NuLawLab</a> counterparts for the first time, and they even brought us pizza!  It was clear that they were all just as excited to be a part of this project as we were.</p>
<p>After some introductions from each of our members, we got right to work with presentations from REV and BIC.  REV presented previous and current work, including <a href="http://www.studiorev.org/projects/nannyvan.htm" target="_blank">Nanny Van</a> and <a href="http://www.studiorev.org/projects/bibliobandido.htm" target="_blank">El Bibliobandido</a>, both of which served as inspiration for how the careful intertwining of art, technology, design, and social change can lead to incredible success.  Natalicia Tracy, executive director of BIC, followed, and she explained to us how BIC arrived at its involvement in the Massachusetts movement for domestic worker rights.</p>
<p>Naturally, after so much inspiration, the team had many questions.  We decided to write them all down on post-it notes, and place them on a wall :</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-family: Georgia, 'Bitstream Charter', serif">&#8211; Are we working on one project? Or several related projects?</span></p>
<p>&#8211; What are the most immediate steps to make?</p>
<p>&#8211; How do NuLawLab/MIT/domestic workers play a role in the design progress?</p>
<p>&#8211; Where is there the most room for creativity?</p></blockquote>
<p>While going through each question, we were able to clarify our goals both in concrete product form and in an idealogical sense.</p>
<p>As a collaboration we wanted to mimic the success of domestic worker hotline in New York, which created characters and used voice recordings to educate workers on their new rights.   The process in New York went a little like this:</p>
<div id="attachment_717" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://codesign.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/photo.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-717" class="size-medium wp-image-717" alt="In a /very/ simplified nutshell" src="http://codesign.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/photo-300x225.jpg" width="300" height="225" srcset="https://codesign.mit.edu/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/photo-300x225.jpg 300w, https://codesign.mit.edu/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/photo-400x300.jpg 400w, https://codesign.mit.edu/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/photo.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-717" class="wp-caption-text">In a /very/ simplified nutshell</p></div>
<p>Domestic workers (DWs) worked with REV to create &#8220;episodes&#8221; based on the new Bill of Rights (B.O.R.).  After some collaborative and iterative redacting, the audio pieces were recorded and the logic tree for the hotline was designed.  At MIT, the technology was finally implemented into a hotline!</p>
<p>As a collaborative group we wanted to work on a similar product that would work towards a few main goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>advancing domestic worker health and safety by both gathering and providing relevant information</li>
<li>engourage base-building and membership mobilizing</li>
<li>creating a detailed and malleable framework capable of producing and sustaining future projects elsewhere in the country</li>
<li>to galvanize new audiences and accelerate the growing movement for workers’ rights in MA and elsewhere</li>
</ul>
<p>Among the ideas thrown around during this meeting were:</p>
<ol>
<li>A Boston-based hotline that would help to spread safety information given to BIC by OSHA (Occupational Safety and Health Administration)</li>
<li>A &#8220;Guide to Culturally-Relevant Spread of Information&#8221;</li>
<li>Video clips to accompany OSHA safety guidelines</li>
<li>An interactive SMS component</li>
</ol>
<p>Of course, time did not let us fully develop each idea but I&#8217;m sure that with such a diverse group, they will solidify, consolidate, and strengthen organically over the coming weeks!</p>

<p>If anyone has suggestions, questions or general comments, please reply!</p>

<p><strong>Project Updates</strong></p>
<p>This week all the student teams visited their community partners.  We spent the first half of class sharing updates and providing feedback about the four collaborative project: <a href="http://www.zumix.org/">Zumix</a>, <a href="http://www.urbanoproject.org/">the Urbano Project</a>, <a href="http://www.studiorev.org/">REV</a>/ <a href="http://www.braziliancenter.org/">The Brazilian Immigrants Center (BIC)</a>, and <a href="http://clvu.org/">City Life / Vida Urbana</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="http://codesign.mit.edu/2013/09/zumix-site-visit/">Zumix team is designing a brainstorm session</a> for their project with young DJs in East Boston.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sGW8TURUyGcI8pZL6QCCpbaK_msfR70cgYOUn6GvWEo/edit">Urbano Project team will continue to discuss</a> how they can extend the organization’s theme “Emancipated City” to a larger audience in Boston through an interactive medium.</li>
<li>The REV/BIC team is building a phone system using VOIP Drupal that will explain domestic worker rights to those who call into the platform.</li>
<li>The City Life / Vida Urbana team aims to overturn the dominant narrative that states the foreclosure crisis is over, and demonstrate that people are still losing their homes.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span id="more-668"></span>Reading Discussion</strong></p>
<p>Next, the class discussed Futurelab’s report<i>, <a href="http://www2.futurelab.org.uk/resources/documents/opening_education/Designing_for_Social_Justice.pdf">Designing for Social Justice</a></i>.   Futurelab is based in the United Kingdom and through research, school development, and workshops, is committed to developing creative and innovative approaches to education, teaching, and learning. This article begins by reviewing the frameworks of John Rawls, Amartya Sen, Friedrich Hayek, and Donald Schon to show how policy-makers and philosophers understand social justice.  From there, it discusses user-centered design processes and outcomes, and the implications for social justice.  Students shared their reflections about the reading.</p>
<p>“Design is not just a matter of producing a result, but reproducing certain values…and in the long term, the process and outcome are equally important,” said one student.  Another responded by describing his personal experience, “I have been in a lot of organizations where too much emphasis is on the process and people burn out and leave and there is no relevant product.  There’s a tension between social justice, design, and approaches that are more corporate and top-down.  There is something to learn from both sides.”  In general, there are two main arguments about why you make design processes participatory:</p>
<ol>
<li>You get a better product when you engage the users and a large number of people. How else do you gather requirements and test usability?</li>
<li>The value-driven argument is that the knowledge of all people is important and the process is more egalitarian.</li>
</ol>
<p>The professor urged students to think critically about the outcomes of participation in their own team projects. “Sometimes process and outcome are not related.” Really good processes can yield terrible products and sometimes closed, top-down processes can produce amazing products.  He explained that for the codesign studio, it is important for everyone to think about each stage of the design process and who is engaged at every step.  There are the staffs of the community organizations and then there’s the “community members” themselves.  What is the flow, process, and intention in each step of the process?</p>
<p><strong>Values-Driven Brainstorm Workshop</strong></p>
<p>After discussing the reading, teaching assistants Willow and Becky <a href="https://hackpad.com/Codesign-vvcHcR1qWIG">led an amazing workshop about values-driven design</a> and showed the class how to uncover personal values. Everyone formed groups of two and followed the below directions.</p>
<ul>
<li>Share something you’ve worked on that you had some role in designing.  Ask each other the following questions:</li>
<li>What did you envision as success for that project?</li>
<li>Imagine that it WAS a success. What is happening in the world then? How are people living, what is the quality of life?</li>
<li>Drill to one word.  That’s the value you were working from and the value you represent.</li>
</ul>
<p>Below is a wordle of the values that our class embodies.</p>
<p><a href="http://codesign.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Values-Worlde.png"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-669" alt="Values Worlde" src="http://codesign.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Values-Worlde.png" width="825" height="536" srcset="https://codesign.mit.edu/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Values-Worlde.png 825w, https://codesign.mit.edu/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Values-Worlde-300x194.png 300w, https://codesign.mit.edu/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Values-Worlde-461x300.png 461w" sizes="(max-width: 825px) 100vw, 825px" /></a></p>
<p>Then each student team and their community partners came together to think about the <strong>Inputs</strong>, <strong>Outputs</strong>, <strong>Outcomes</strong>, and <strong>Impact</strong> of their proposed projects.  An <strong>input</strong> refers to what each team has such as people, materials, space, and assets and an <strong>output</strong> is the idea, concept, project, action or product that the team will create. An <strong>outcome</strong> is a momentary shift and <strong>impact</strong> is a lasting change.</p>
