								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Has it already been two weeks? Holy wow.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll be aggregating the summaries from the Countersurveillance DiscoTechs across the world over the next week. This first one is easy enough, because I was there! This post shamelessly yoinked from my own blog, with mild adaptations.</p>
<h1>Countersurveillance DiscoTechs</h1>
<p>With the <a href="http://codesign.mit.edu">Codesign Studio</a> I TA with the Media Lab, a series of Discovery Technology (DiscoTech) Workshops were put on. The ones in Bangalore, Ramallah, Mexico City, Boston, and San Francisco were all inspiring. You can see more about the projects, art, and progress over on <a href="http://surveillance.hackpad.com">our hackpad</a>. Some examples were stories from Venezuelan activists, face painting to deter facial recognition (so hard!), long-time surveillance on poor communities in America, and spoofing DNA.</p>
<p>And seriously. Take a few minutes to go through the <a href="https://surveillance.hackpad.com/collection/obquIuziznY">partner pages</a> for this. Need a bit of morning outrage? Think everything&#8217;s going pretty ok in the world? Nope!</p>
<h1>UI/UX for Crypto Tools Hackathon</h1>
<p>The second usability hackathon with <a href="http://openitp.org">OpenITP</a> went incredibly well, and repped as the San Francisco DiscoTech as well as its own thing.<br />

The number of projects worked on is <em>impressive</em>, to say the least. You can read more about the objectives of the sprint and what was accomplished via the associated links.</p>
<h2><a title="https://guardianproject.info/" href="https://guardianproject.info/">Guardian Project:</a> <a title="https://surveillance.hackpad.com/Guardian-BazaarKerplapp-fdSE6Pm9CFd" href="https://surveillance.hackpad.com/Guardian-BazaarKerplapp-fdSE6Pm9CFd">Bazaar</a> and <a title="https://surveillance.hackpad.com/Guardian-InformaCam-Data-Viz-Cow8uacPR7w" href="https://surveillance.hackpad.com/Guardian-InformaCam-Data-Viz-Cow8uacPR7w">InformaCam</a></h2>

<p>People&#8217;s Intelligence is an<a title="http://www.thetechchallenge.org/winners/alert.html" href="http://www.thetechchallenge.org/winners/alert.html"> award winning idea</a> that makes use of USSD, SMS and voice to establish a conversation with victims and witnesses of mass atrocities. The envisaged tool helps victims and witnesses to better document and verify their stories and provides them as well as relevant organisations with actionable information, thereby facilitating early warning and targeted assistance. It supports analysis and allows networking between affected communities, relevant organisations and experts through the use of ubiquitous technologies.</p>

It integrates directly into the webmail user interface; its elements are non-intrusive and easy to use in a user&#8217;s regular workflow.</p>
<h1><a href="http://rightscon.org">RightsCon</a></h1>
<p>It was really nice to completely surrounded by the people I usually see when we all jam into the one or two sessions at any tech or policy event which involve both. But that overlap was <em>the whole conference</em>, so we were able to dive in much deeper, see more nuance, and see next steps. I learned about funder motives, and the initiatives which backed tech in atrocity prevention/detection/accountability, and about many many tools used to amplify the voices of marginalized people. I drew <em>a lot</em>, and I hugged even more.</p>
<h2>VizNotes</h2>
<p><iframe src="http://prezi.com/embed/zyeuhtzwqo-o/?bgcolor=ffffff&amp;lock_to_path=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;autohide_ctrls=0&amp;features=undefined&amp;disabled_features=undefined" height="400" width="550" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>Full set on <a href="http://viz.bl00cyb.org/tag/rightscon/">bl00viz</a>.</p>
<h2>Typed Notes!</h2>
<p>I typed notes for two interactive sessions for sake of formatting. One was a review of the the UI/UX hackathon the weekend before, the other was stories from the field and suggestions for how to be better trainers. Those can be found <a href="http://civic.mit.edu/category/blog-tags/rightscon">over on the Civic blog</a>.</p>
<h1>Responsible Data Forum</h1>
<p>Thursday I trekked out to Oakland to participate in <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org">Engine Room</a>&#8216;s Responsible Data Forum, as hosted by the inspirational <a href="http://aspirationtech.org">Aspiration Tech</a>. Again, I was spoiled by being surrounded by an impressively diverse set of people interested in the same fulcrum of concern and change. We skeletoned out plans for checklists before collecting data, and workflows that include project death, and illustrated how data moves through a company. We talked hosting and coercion resistant design and informed consent. We also talked about context-based privacy in disasters. I&#8217;m looking forward to seeing what comes of the day.</p>
