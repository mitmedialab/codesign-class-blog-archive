								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Video of the workshop!<br />
<iframe width="584" height="438" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/LzGdTe1qoJ4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>This week on Monday night, the Zumix Team conducted a design/brainstorm workshop with the youth DJs at their monthly meeting. We felt that this workshop was very important as part of the collaborative process because we wanted the DJs to be able to give input on the potential projects since they are the ones most involved with the radio program at Zumix. We hoped to use this opportunity to not only to brainstorm but also to engage the DJs so that they will be more excited about the project.</p>
<p>The workshop had a great turnout, with 10 people attending, not including the Zumix team. The DJs who attended ranged from 4th graders to high school juniors. After a few minutes of quick introductions, we presented the ideas that we had thought of prior: storytelling booth, old fashioned radio playhouse, general marketing/publicity things. After we presented, we opened it up to the kids to have them give input. They were generally favorable of the ideas and gave ideas for publicity schemes such as giving away free guitar picks or getting sponsors from the local network. After the ideation phase, we broke up everyone into groups of 3-4 and had each group draw what they want the project to look like. They came up with the following creative ideas!</p>
<p><b>Group 1:</b><br />
<a href="http://codesign.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/IMG_0080.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-702" alt="IMG_0080" src="http://codesign.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/IMG_0080-300x224.jpg" width="300" height="224" srcset="https://codesign.mit.edu/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/IMG_0080-300x224.jpg 300w, https://codesign.mit.edu/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/IMG_0080-1024x764.jpg 1024w, https://codesign.mit.edu/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/IMG_0080-401x300.jpg 401w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><br />
This group combined the storybooth and old fashioned into one idea where there is a storybooth with a radio inside. They thought about putting the contraption in very visible places such as the state center or in front of the T station so that it can attract many people. People who come up to the booth would be able to share stories using the microphone. There could also be remote broadcast and music playing.</p>
<p><b>Group 2:</b></p>
<p><a href="http://codesign.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/group2.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-706" alt="group2" src="http://codesign.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/group2-224x300.jpg" width="224" height="300" srcset="https://codesign.mit.edu/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/group2-224x300.jpg 224w, https://codesign.mit.edu/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/group2-764x1024.jpg 764w" sizes="(max-width: 224px) 100vw, 224px" /></a><br />
The second group came up with a bunch of ideas for marketing and publicity strategies for Zumix radio. These include putting Zumix in bigger news outlets such as the Boston Herald and in the local TV station in the community and having Zumix movie nights. They also came up with ideas for publicity materials such as passing out keychains and creating a promotional DVD to hand out to different organizations and networks.</p>
<p><b>Group 3:</b></p>
<p><a href="http://codesign.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/group3.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-707" alt="group3" src="http://codesign.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/group3-300x224.jpg" width="300" height="224" srcset="https://codesign.mit.edu/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/group3-300x224.jpg 300w, https://codesign.mit.edu/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/group3-1024x764.jpg 1024w, https://codesign.mit.edu/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/group3-401x300.jpg 401w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><br />
The third group thought of a box of Zumix idea that, as one DJ put it, “kind of like a jack in the box but without the thing popping out.” It is a box shaped storytelling booth. When people go inside, they would be able to see their reflection, to emphasize that they are telling their own stories. They can also choose what song to listen to as they tell their story. The 4 outside walls of the box will be decorated with an artist statement, directions, mission statement, and hand prints. There can also be speakers outside for playing music to attract visitors.</p>
<p>At the end of the drawing activities, everyone was very excited to get started on the projects. There was talk to maybe combine the three main ideas into one project, but we would need to more research on how feasible that would be. A big concern that we have is portability. The next steps are to decide on a final project and make plans to implement it.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Despite our best efforts to find a common time when everyone was available, we weren&#8217;t able to meet as of the time this blog post is being written. As such, our team has been utilizing several googledocs as well as online chatting to discuss our MOU. In our discussions about decision making in particular, Peter proposed using the framework proposed by <a title="Seeds for Change" href="http://seedsforchange.org.uk/consensus#proc">Seeds for Change</a>, which ties in collaborative and participatory aspects, values that Urbano strives to promote as an organization.</p>
